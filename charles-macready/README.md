Farewell! Left London at half-past eleven and reached Canterbury at half-past six.[^ref1]
Broadstairs, August 29th 1840 — Left Canterbury in a chaise, and came very slowly along to Broadstairs ; was pleased to look again upon the fields and trees, though it seemed like a surprise to me to see the stubble fields and the harvest gathered. The beauty of the wild flowers by the roadside, few as they were, was sweet and pleasing to my sight. I found my wife and dear family all well, thank God, and after breakfast lay down for two of three hours.[^ref2] I arranged my accounts and surrendered all the rest of my day to idleness and the enjoyment of the society of my dear children. Was much irritated and annoyed by the report of fresh instances of impertinence and falsehood in the Observer newspaper. My anger was greatly excited, but reflection shows me that the baseness is only elevated by taking notice of it.

August 3Oth 1840. — Read — indeed almost spelled — the newspaper. Listened to my children's repetition of French fables and verses. After their dinner walked out to call on Dickens — who had not arrived — then on the cliffs and on the sands. Spent an idle evening with my family.

August 31st 1840. — Left Margate in the iron steamboat, which I did not like at all in the heavy swell that we had to ride through nearly to Gravesend. The boat was so light, being of metal, that her motion made me very uncomfortable. There was abundance of sickness and altogether a disagreeable passage. As it grew dark the effect of the various and many boats with their lights on their prows and mast- heads gliding through the water had a very beautiful effect. Came by the Blackwall Railway to London.

December 4th. — Set out, Catherine and self, for the Dover station. Dined at Folkestone, where we were detained till four o'clock by the non-arrival of the packet; went on board a nasty, miserable little boat, called the Water Witch , stowed full of passengers; good deal of wind and very heavy sea made our passage, of four hours' duration, perfectly miserable.

Letter from Mrs. Ratcliffe, quite destroying my hopes of Tonbridge. Acted Hamlet in my best style. Called. Mrs. Warner came into my room and gave me from the managers a cheque for £800 !

1849
Canterbury November 11th. — Dearest Catherine's birthday. Left Canterbury by train at a little after six o'clock, and slept almost the whole way to London. A very rude and coarse person, a Jew, addressed me in the refreshment-room at Ashford to ask whether I " was well patronized last night." I was quite at a loss to answer the man's impertinence, but, like others, he supposes players may be spoken to by any one !

<!-- Anna died on the 9 June 1871, at Halstead Place, near Sevenoaks and is buried in St. Margaret's Churchyard. Sir John Hershel, her friend and inspiration, had died a month earlier at his home Collingwood, near Hawkhurst.  Anna's obituary describes her as an 'amiable and benevolent lady'[^ref15], but her early experimentation in photography is not mentioned.
