Leonard Digges (c.1515 – c.1559), mathematician and cartographer, was born at Wootton, near Canterbury, the son of James Digges of Digges Court, Barham, and Philippa Egham of Chart. His family were well connected landowners within the county.

Leonard is credited with the invention of the theodolite, a surveying instrument that is usually mounted on a tripod with adjustable legs. It is used to obtain precise angular measurements for triangulation and is traditionally used in surveying land, but now has uses in meteorology and rocket launching, as well as building and infrastructure construction.
<br><br>
He is also credited with independently inventing the reflecting telescope, or refracting telescope as part of his theodolite to improve accuracy over long distances of his surveying work.

Digges had responsibility for coastal defence between Dover and Folkestone in 1545 and took part in the unsuccessful rebellion led by the Protestant Thomas Wyatt. He was convicted of high treason and sentenced to death for his part in the rebellion, but he received a pardon in April 1554. His land and goods were taken and he was fined 400 marks.

Leonard married Bridget Wilford of Hartridge and had several children, including Thomas Digges (1546–1595) who became a notable mathematician and astronomer. He expanded on much of his father's works and made many contributions to astronomy.

Thomas Digges was the first to explain the Copernican system (an astronomical model developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, which was substantially correct and gave a correct cause of the seasons, and accurately predicts relative distances of planets from the Sun) in English, making it more accessible to the British population. He also made his own additions, disagreeing with the idea of a fixed shell of immovable stars, but proposed an infinite number of stars at varying distances.

He was also the first to postulate the dark night sky paradox, which says that if there is an infinite number of stars distributed in an infinitely large space then such a universe would be bright rather than dark e.g. any line of sight from the Earth would end on the surface of a star and so the night sky should be completely illuminated and bright.
