It is believed that John Lyly, dramatist, courtier, and parliamentarian, was born in Canterbury in 1554, as his father Peter was the registrar for Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in the year of his birth. Baptism registers of St Alphege church in the city of Canterbury contain the names of 6 of the 8 children born to Peter and Jane Lyly, suggesting John was also baptised here, however Peter Lyly also acted as a lawyer in Rochester in 1550, so other sources name this as his birthplace instead[^ref1] John's childhood home was possibly the 'Splayed Eagle' in Sun or Palace Street, quite close to the cathedral, as this property is named in his father's will. It is likely that John attended the King's School in Canterbury with Christopher Marlowe as his brothers William and Peter are known to have attended the school.

Lyly studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, where his matriculation entry describes him as a Kentishman.[^ref3] In 1576, Lyly went to London where he was famed for publishing two prose romances, 'Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit' (1578) and 'Euphues and His England' (1580). 'Euphues and His England' is a comedy which follows the journey of Euphues and Philautus who travel to England from Athens. Euphues tells Philautus on the way that England ‘is in fashion three cornered, where-off one side is toward Fraunce, the one corner of this side which is Kent, wher for the most part Ships ariue out of Fraunce…Of all the Inhabitaunts of this Isse, the Kentishmen are most ciuilest [civilest], the which country marcheth altogether vpon the Sea, & differeth not greatly from the manner of Fraunce.’ Whilst in England, one of the characters they meet is a ‘fatherly and friendly Sire’ named Fidus, who tells them he is a beekeeper from Kent. 

...kenne of Douer, which the Maister espying with a chéerefull voyce waking them,...
...white Cliffes which easely you may perceiue, are Douer hills, wherevnto is..

Philatus who suffers from sea-sickness scarcely hears his companion's chatter and is ‘more ready to tell what wood the ship was made of than to answer to Euphues’ discourse’.

He quickly gained the reputation of England's most fashionable writer of the 1580s. 

After this he began writing comedies and was also a Member of Parliament

In 1583 he took charge of Blackfriars Theatre, producing his early plays 'Campaspe' and 'Sapho and Phao'. His other more popular plays include 'Gallathea' (1584) and 'Endimion' (1591), called his 'masterpiece' by Daniel. All his plays were performed privately for Queen Elizabeth as well as to the public.

Lyly's book 'Pappe with an hatchet. Alias, a figge for my godson. or Cracke me this nut' (1589) was a reply to the seditious Martin Mar-prelate tracts that had illegally circulated England in 1588 and 1589 and which were highly critical of the episcopacy. He wrote: 'These Martins were hatcht of addle egges, els could they not haue such idle heads'.[^ref8] His respect for the church may be linked to his childhood experiences in Canterbury. He accuses Martins of insincerity saying 'I sawe through his paper coffen, that it was but a cosening corse, and one that had learnde of the holie maid of Kent', [Elizabeth Barton](/medieval/barton-biography).


The growing popularity of Thomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare led to decline in Lyly's popularity and Lyly began to struggle financially.
His desperate appeals for a job were not answered by Queen Elizabeth and he was outlived by Edmund Tilney for the post of Master of the Revels

His drama 'Mother Bombie' (1594) is set in Rochester, Kent, and is a comedy about two sets of couples and their respective fathers’ meddling in their matches.

- developed unusual and pioneering style known as "euphuism": described by Britannica as "an elegant Elizabethan literary style marked by excessive use of balance, antithesis, and alliteration and by frequent use of similes drawn from mythology and nature."

name derived from the name of the character of his first two prose romances, Euphues
- light, fanciful, 'artificial'
- style was highly influential, being used by Robert Greene and William Shakespeare; yet was also mocked by such writers and fell out of fashion
- comedic dramas also draw from classical mythology and characters engage in euphuistic dialogue, and can be seen to have influenced several of Shakespeare's
- plays were all acted by children, and all were written in prose apart from 'The Woman in the Moon' 
- his plays, which would come to be criticised for their euphuistic style, could be argued to be of the style which the Queen preferred

He died in 1606, London as a poor man and is buried at St Bartholomew the Less.
