'My heart throbbes, my eares tingle, my minde misgiues mee, since I heare such muttering of marry-ages in Rochester' - Vicinia in _Mother Bombie_ (1894)
<br>
John Lyly, dramatist, courtier, and parliamentarian, was born in Rochester or Canterbury in 1554. His father Peter was the registrar for Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in the year of his birth and baptism registers of St Alphege church in the city of Canterbury contain the names of 6 of the 8 children born to Peter and Jane Lyly. However Peter Lyly also acted as a lawyer in Rochester in 1550, so other sources name this as John's birthplace.[^ref1] Peter owned the 'Splayed Eagle' in Sun or Palace Street, quite close to Canterbury cathedral, and at least two of his younger sons William and Peter attended the King's School in Canterbury at the same time as Christopher Marlowe (c.1578-80).

Lyly studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, where his matriculation entry describes him as a Kentishman.[^ref3] In 1576, he moved to London where he was famed for publishing two prose romances, 'Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit' (1578) and 'Euphues and His England' (1580). He quickly gained a reputation as England's most fashionable writer.'Euphues and His England' was dedicated to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, and follows the journey of Euphues and Philautus from Athens to England. Euphues describes England as ‘is in fashion three cornered, where-off one side is toward Fraunce, the one corner of this side which is Kent, wher for the most part Ships ariue out of Fraunce… Of all the Inhabitaunts of this Isse, the Kentishmen are most ciuilest, the which country marcheth altogether vpon the Sea, & differeth not greatly from the manner of Fraunce.’ Whilst in England, they meet a ‘fatherly and friendly Sire’ named Fidus, who tells them he is a beekeeper from Kent. 

...kenne of Douer, which the Maister espying with a chéerefull voyce waking them,...
...white Cliffes which easely you may perceiue, are Douer hills, wherevnto is..

Philatus who suffers from sea-sickness scarcely hears his companion's chatter and is ‘more ready to tell what wood the ship was made of than to answer to Euphues’ discourse’.

Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, who fell out of favour with Queen Elizabeth I in the early 1580s.

He quickly gained the reputation of England's most fashionable writer of the 1580s. He dedicated 'Eupheus and His England' to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, who fell out of favour with Queen Elizabeth I in the early 1580s.

After this he began writing comedies and was also a Member of Parliament

In 1583 he took charge of Blackfriars Theatre, [add in link to de Vere here] producing his early plays 'Campaspe' and 'Sapho and Phao'. His other more popular plays include 'Gallathea' (1584) and 'Endimion' (1591), called his 'masterpiece' by Daniel. All his plays were performed privately for Queen Elizabeth as well as to the public and were designed to flatter the Queen.

In 1589, Lyly was hired by the government to write 'Pappe with an hatchet. Alias, a figge for my godson. or Cracke me this nut' (1589) as a reply to the seditious Martin Mar-prelate tracts that had illegally circulated England in 1588 and 1589 and which were highly critical of the episcopacy. He wrote: 'These Martins were hatcht of addle egges, els could they not haue such idle heads'.[^ref8] He accuses Martin of insincerity saying 'I sawe through his paper coffen, that it was but a cosening corse, and one that had learnde of the holie maid of Kent'.[^ref9] The Holy Maid of Kent was [Elizabeth Barton](/medieval/barton-biography), who had been executed for her condemnatory prophecies against Elizabeth I's parents, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. 

After this, Lyly served as an MP between 1589-1601. The growing popularity of Thomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare led to decline in Lyly's popularity and it is at this period that he wrote his 'realistic' comedy 'Mother Bombie' (1594) set in Rochester, which is a story of fathers who attempt to meddle in the marriage matches of their children. Mother Bombie who is described as cunning (possibly a witch) and 'the good woman of Rochester' offers advice to the characters as the farce unfolds. In Act 2 Scene 1, Livia, the daughter of Priscius, says of her entangled affairs: 'Pop three knaues in a sheath, Ile make it a right Tunbridge case and be the bodkin' to which Riscio replies 'Nay , the bodkin is here already ; you must be the knife'. Clarkson has argued that there is some evidence of leather-making in the Weald of Kent, with transportation of some of the materials via the ports of Rochester to London. It is possible that Lyly's London audience would have known about Tunbridge leather sheaths or cases. Lloyd (1913) linked the reference to small-scale cutlery production in the Tonbridge area, although Tydeman (1984) argued that Tonbridge did not have a metal industry. It is possible that it refers to the iron industry of the Weald as Sir Thomas Fane (c. 1538–1589), who had been implicated in Wyatt's rebellion, had a furnace at Tonbridge.[^ref10].  Sir Thomas Wyatt had planned to raise a militia in Kent against Mary I and replace Mary with her half-sister Elizabeth. Several Kentish landowners, including [Leonard Digges](/16c/digges-biography) of Barham, had had their lands confiscated. Lyly was capable of political satire. RUBBISH MICHELLE

Although the action takes place in Rochester, Ashford and Canterbury are also mentioned. Halfpenny, the page of Sperantus, is described as having acquired his love of drinking 'sack' "heere in Kent at Ashford" and Memphio's page Dromio compared the price of two hackneys hired "for ten grotes a pece to saie seruice on sunday" as being "no more than a post horse from hence to Canterbury."


The growing popularity of Thomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare led to decline in Lyly's popularity and Lyly began to struggle financially.
His desperate appeals for a job were not answered by Queen Elizabeth and he was outlived by Edmund Tilney for the post of Master of the Revels

In 1601, Lyly petitioned Elizabeth for the post of Master of Revels writing: "Thirteen yeres your highnes servant but yet nothing. Twenty friends that though they saye they will be sure, I finde them sure to be slowe. A thousand hopes, but all nothing; a hundred promises but yet nothing. Thus casting up the inventory of my friends, hopes, promises and tymes, the summa totalis amounteth to just nothing." It was his second of three petitions for the post.

- developed unusual and pioneering style known as "euphuism": described by Britannica as "an elegant Elizabethan literary style marked by excessive use of balance, antithesis, and alliteration and by frequent use of similes drawn from mythology and nature."

name derived from the name of the character of his first two prose romances, Euphues
- light, fanciful, 'artificial'
- style was highly influential, being used by Robert Greene and William Shakespeare; yet was also mocked by such writers and fell out of fashion
- comedic dramas also draw from classical mythology and characters engage in euphuistic dialogue, and can be seen to have influenced several of Shakespeare's
- plays were all acted by children, and all were written in prose apart from 'The Woman in the Moon' 
- his plays, which would come to be criticised for their euphuistic style, could be argued to be of the style which the Queen preferred

He died in 1606, London as a poor man and is buried at St Bartholomew the Less.
