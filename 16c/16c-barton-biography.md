Elizabeth Barton, 'The Holy Maid of Kent' was born in Aldington in 1506 [^ref1]. She was employed as a servant to Thomas Cobb, steward of the Archbishop of Canterbury in the 1520s,[^ref2] however, at the age of nineteen her health began to deteriorate, so much so that it was feared that she had been stricken with a mortal disease.[^ref7]  She was in ‘grievous paine, in-so-much as a man woulde have thought that shee had suffered the pangs of death intselfe, until the disease descended and dell down into the bodie againe.’[^ref8]  It was at this period that she began to experience "curious" visions [^ref9] and predicted that her master’s son would die. She began describing church services that she had not attended[^ref10] and shared the glories that she had seen of heaven and the agonies of hell with her neighbours and mistress. She also predicted that she would visit the chapel of Our Lady of Court-at-Street where she would be healed.[^ref11]

Astonished with Barton’s knowledge of the unseen world and future, Thomas Cobb invited the parish priest Richard Masters to visit Barton and hear some of her revelations for himself, after which Masters communicated 'of the prophetess Elizabeth Barton' to Archbishop Warham.[^ref13]  Upon hearing the news, Archbishop Warham sent an ecclesiastical commission led by Edward Bocking, a monk form the Benedictine house of Christ Church, Canterbury to examine Barton.[^ref14]  She was questioned, and the commission found her orthodox on the points of faith. The commission accompanied Barton to the chapel of Our Lady in the village of Court-at-Street in 1526 and it was here in front of neighbours, friends, masters and mistresses and the commission that she was miraculously healed.[^ref15] William Lambarde states in his _Perambulation of Kent_ that upon visiting the chapel Barton was revived ‘from the very point of death,’ and that her healing ‘should be rong for a miracle.’[^ref12]

Under the guidance of the commission, Barton entered the convent of St. Sepulchre in Canterbury, where she received the spiritual direction of Edward Bocking.[^ref16]  Barton’s reputation for sanctity became wide spread leading to her reputation as a miracle worker and seer:[^ref17]  ‘She was held in some esteem by the nuns at Syon Abbey, monks at the Charterhouses of Sheen and London, and the friars at Canterbury, Greenwich and Richmond, and had audiences with Henry VIII, Cardinal Wolsey, Sir Thomas More, Archbishop Warham and Bishop Fisher.’[^ref18]  However, her prophecies became increasingly contentious, and [^ref19] when she attacked the kings credibility and propriety, it was felt that she had gone too far.[^ref20]

Barton warned Thomas Wolsey and Sir Thomas More of the dreadful consequences that would befall Henry VIII should he divorce Catherine of Aragon.[^ref21]  She was given an audience with the King in 1528 and warned him that if he married Anne Boleyn the vengeance of God would plague him.[^ref22] Henry VIII ignored her but she continued to gain followers, and a year later she had another vision.[^ref23] This time, she told told him that his voluptuousness and carnal appetite were leading him to disgrace God’s law and that if he divorced Catherine and married Anne he was going to die a miserable death within a month of his marriage and he would be seen as a shameful king. Henry dismissed her and never invited her to the royal presence again.[^ref24]

Barton lost her protectors when Thomas Wolsey died in 1530 and Archbishop Warham in 1532, leaving only Sir Thomas More who was a cautious supporter.[^ref25]  Her predictions started "to allow doubt to enter the minds of her supporters and allowing rebellion to enter the hearts of others". Anne Boleyn welcomed the King to her bed and almost immediately fell pregnant, and they secretly wed.[^ref26]  Queen Catherine and Sir Thomas More who were unaware of the marriage, continued to used Barton’s prophecies against Henry.[^ref27]  After the King didn’t die as Barton had prophesised, the King divorced Catherine and his marriage to Anne was made public when she was crowned Queen on 1 June 1533.[^ref28] Barton refused to deny papal authority, despite new legislation declaring Henry to be the Supreme Head of the English church.[^ref29]

Barton was accused of treason and witchcraft, and it was believed that she and her associates spread false prophecies concerning the king’s marriage. These prophecies were called by Parliament to be ‘lyes by them unlawfully and traiterously practysed devysed ymagyned and conspired, as well to the blasphemy of Almyghty God.’[^ref30] Parliament believed that Barton’s words concerning the end of Henry’s reign should be punishable by death, however they did not wish to make Barton a Catholic martyr, instead they attempted to discredit her reputation and make her a traitor.[^ref31] Sermons and interrogations were preached across England portraying Barton as a a fraud. Barton was attacked by opponents that claimed she was in communication with the devil, and that she was having an affair with her confessor Edward Bocking. [^ref32]

Barton posed a threat to Henry’s reign and the stability of the monarchy, and Parliament feared rebellion.[^ref33] For Barton this was a religious issue, so she placed papal authority above that of the kings. Due Barton’s commitment to the institution, the Reformation she sought to discredit could not be ignored. Barton held influence and almost 3000 people attended one of her miraculous experiences, she did not only have support of the lower society but had support from the wealthy and powerful, transcending social class boundaries.[^ref34] 

Barton’s life illustrates the chaotic and complicated nature of the Henrician Reformation. Barton was seen as a religious deviant that endangered Henry’s throne with the transgression of gender boundaries and public disapproval of King Henry’s Polices.[^ref35] It believed that Barton denied under interrogation her revelations and prophecies, however this did not stop the fidelity of many of her supporters.[^ref36]  Nevertheless, Henry sought out punishment against Barton and her followers, emphasising the fact that she had communicated with the devil and committed treason against him, after being found guilty she was publicly hung for treason and witchcraft on 20 April 1534. The public hanging was intended to be understood as a symbolic act, her body and the bodies of her supporters were left as a show that she was nothing but a venerable, broken and impure person.[^ref37]  The date of Barton’s execution holds significance as it was the same day that citizens were required to make the Oath of Succession, bringing the meaning for Barton’s corpse and those of her supporters to become visual statements of the government’s determination to silence those who criticize Henry VIII’s policies and reforms.[^ref38]
