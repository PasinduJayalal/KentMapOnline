The Battle of Britain Memorial site is situated on top of the White Cliffs in Capel-Le-Ferne, Kent. Dedicated to those of Churchill’s Few, it occupies a special place in the hearts and minds of those who have visited the site. 
The site itself has seen conflict from both world wars. RNAS Capel which later became RAF Folkestone was a First World War airship station, being close to Dover and the open fields of Capel-le-Ferne were seen as an ideal location for a base and worked started on the site in April 1915 and was kept operational until 1919 when the station closed.  The purpose of the airships was to patrol the coast and escort shipping across the channel, the site had three large airship sheds and a large grass landing area.

During World War two, during the year of 1940 there was an urgent need for the guns to defend the coast, with the order from Winston Churchill to order six 8-inch-high performance guns to boost coastal defences. The construction of these guns began and the vantage point was formed to provide anti-shipping defensive fire in the English Channel, it is important to add here there is only twenty miles from Dover to France!  These guns were 8” naval guns with a long-range defence, two were placed on the cliffs, one at Capel-le-Ferne the other at Houghman, West Dover. These guns had extreme ranges and were successful in engaging enemy shipping targets at the range of 28,030M(17 miles away!) 
The Memorial idea to “The Few” came from one of their own, Wing Commander Geoffrey Page after his years of active service with the RAF flying in the Battle of Britain, He was awarded the Distinguished flying cross in 1943 (DFC) and received the Distinguished Service Order(DSO) the following year. Geoffrey’s career with the RAF ended in 1948, however years later to his amazement he realised there was no such memorial to his comrades who fought in the battle and in his determination to remember those who fought in the battle and at “Hellfire Corner”  as it became known due to heavy conflict between Folkestone and Dover.

Geoffrey founded the Battle of Britain trust which raised more than £1 million with which the Battle of Britain memorial was created in 1993 by the HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.  The design of the central stature was carved by Harry Gray a sculptor in Cambridge.  The design idea came about, after Harry’s work colleague sat in the pose during a break and this became the inspiration behind the contemplative memorial. Furthermore, the figure wears an Irvin jacket for a very symbolic reason it hides the airman’s uniform which disguises the rank and nationality of the airman- the reason for this is simple but poignant, such an array of service personal fought in the Battle of Britain who is to say is who? This way, the reflection could be a British officer or it could be a Gunner, who is to say? The monument can reflect who it is personal to.

The memorial wall was unveiled later in 2005 by HRH Prince Michael. The wall contains the names of all those who have flown during the Battle of Britain in 1940 including those who survived the war.  The wall memorial could not have been erected if not for the raising of the funds by one of the few and the first president of the Battle of Britain trust Sir Christopher Foxley-Norris, which is where the memorial wall has got its name as tribute.  The poem which can be seen on the left hand side of the memorial wall is by William Walker, a Battle of Britain veteran shared the copyright to the trust to create an anthology of William’s poetry dedicated to his absent friends and experiences of wartime, another touching tribute to the memorial.

In 2015 – The final touches were added to the new visitor centre at the site, now renamed The Wing. The reason it has the name of the wing, is due to the unique design which is the shape of a spitfire wing, designed by a local architectural practice named Godden Allen Lawn.  The Wing is not a museum but an experience and hands on attraction which includes visual and audial effects to show what the Few perhaps experienced in those days during the Summer of 1940. Complete with a further education room, two replica aircraft, a spitfire and hurricane in the grounds, complete with a very quaint and quiet tearoom room with a balcony offering the stunning views the white cliffs provide. 
The memorial in its entity, is a very poignant reminder of what Britain faced in those final years of war with Germany. 
In the very famous words echoed around the world by Sir Winston Churchill; “Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few”
