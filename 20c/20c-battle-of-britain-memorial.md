The Battle of Britain Memorial site is situated on top of the White Cliffs in Capel-Le-Ferne, near Folkestone. Dedicated to those of Churchill’s Few, it occupies a special place in the hearts and minds of those who have visited the site. It commemorates the battle which took place between 10 July – 31 October 1940.

The area around Capel-le-Ferne was of strategic significance during both world wars. RNAS (Royal Naval Air Station) Capel, which later became RAF Folkestone, was a First World War airship station which had had three airship sheds and a large grass landing area. Being close to Dover, it was seen as an ideal location and was operational from April 1915 until 1919 when the station closed. The airships spotted enemy u-boats and escorted shipping across the channel.

During the Second World War, coastal defence was again vital. In 1940, Winston Churchill ordered six 8-inch-high performance guns to boost coastal defences. Two were positioned on top of the cliffs to provide anti-shipping defensive fire in the Channel -  one at Capel-le-Ferne and the other at Hougham. These guns had extreme ranges and were successful in engaging enemy shipping targets at the range of 28,030 metres.

The idea for a Memorial to “The Few” came from one of their own, Wing Commander Geoffrey Page. After his involvment in the Battle of Britain, he was awarded the Distinguished flying Cross (DFC) in 1943 and received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) the following year. Geoffrey’s career with the RAF ended in 1948, however years later to his amazement he realised there was no such memorial to his comrades who fought in the battle.

Geoffrey established the Battle of Britain Trust which raised more than £1 million to fund the memorial. The central statue was designed and carved by Harry Gray. The inspiration for the design idea came about, after Harry’s work colleague sat in the pose during a break. The figure wears an Irvin jacket for a very symbolic reason, in that it hides the airman’s uniform, thus disguising the rank and nationality of the airman. The reason for this is simple but poignant, as such an array of service personal fought in the Battle of Britain it does not privilege one rank or unit. This way, the reflection could be a British officer or it could be a Gunner, who is to say? The monument can reflect who it is personal to. The statue was unveiled in 1993 by the HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.

The memorial wall was unveiled in 2005 by HRH Prince Michael. The wall contains the names of all those who fought during the Battle of Britain including those who survived the war.  The wall memorial could not have been erected if not for the raising of the funds by one of the few and the first president of the Battle of Britain trust Sir Christopher Foxley-Norris, which is where the memorial wall has got its name as tribute.  The poem which can be seen on the left hand side of the memorial wall is by William Walker, a Battle of Britain veteran shared the copyright to the trust to create an anthology of William’s poetry dedicated to his absent friends and experiences of wartime, another touching tribute to the memorial.

In 2015, the final touches were added to the new visitor centre at the site, now renamed The Wing due to its unique design in the shape of a Spitfire wing d. It was designed by a local architectural practice named Godden Allen Lawn.  The Wing is not a museum but an experience and hands on attraction which includes visual and audial effects to show what the Few perhaps experienced in those days during the Summer of 1940. Complete with a further education room, two replica aircraft, a spitfire and hurricane in the grounds, complete with a very quaint and quiet tearoom room with a balcony offering the stunning views the white cliffs provide. 
The memorial in its entity, is a very poignant reminder of what Britain faced in those final years of war with Germany. 
In the very famous words echoed around the world by Sir Winston Churchill; “Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few”
