In 1909 Cicely Hamilton’s play ‘How the Vote Was Won’ was performed at the Dover Town Hall, following a performance in London a few months previously. 

First performed in London in April 1909 and set in the home of a married couple in Brixton, ‘How the Vote Was Won’ follows Horace and Ethel Cole on the day of a Suffragette-caused women’s worker strike. Originally both are against the Suffrage movement, but as more and more women quit their jobs, relatives of Horace begin to insist upon living with them as they will remain out of work until it’s “recognised” by the government via their right to vote. As the women of the family arrive Horace and Ethel realise the Suffrage movement isn’t for nothing and the importance of the female right to vote. 

‘How the Vote Was Won’ was performed here at the Maison Dieu on the 16 July 1909, nine years before the socially upheaving Representation of the People Act of 1918 which finally gave women the right to vote, although it wasn’t until the 1928 Equal Franchise Act that the right to vote became entirely equal.

If you read ‘Suffragettes of Kent’, and we very much recommend that you do, then you come across the Dover cast list for this performance, and it is as follows:

The cast list of the play:
Horace Cole: Mr. E. Chitty
Ethel Cole: Miss Adams
Winifred (Ethel’s sister): Mrs Jellicoe
Agatha Cole (Horace’s sister): Miss Crookewit
Molly (his niece): Miss Bishop
Madame Christine (distant relative): Miss Marchant
Maudie Spark (his first cousin): Miss Fry
Miss Lizzie Wilkins (his aunt): Mrs. Carson
Lily (the maid): Miss Villiers
Gerald Williams (a neighbour): Mr Wigley 

Hamilton herself was a feminist writer, playwright and actress, co-writing popular suffrage plays such as ‘How the Vote Was Won’ with Christopher St John, which was performed here at the Maison Dieu in July 1909, following its performance in London three months before. Like Virginia Woolf, Hamilton believed sexual stereotyping and economic discrimination were more basic issues than disenfranchisement. However, unlike Woolf, Hamilton was active in the Suffragette Movement and co-founded the Women's Writers’ Suffrage League. Additionally, Hamilton was persuaded by Edy Craig to write the script for ‘The Pageant of Great Women’ which is considered one of the most important pieces of suffrage propaganda, as well as writing the lyrics to Ethel Smyth’s suffrage anthem ‘The March of the Women’. 

The Maison Dieu was a hub for suffragette meetings at a time when the campaign for women’s rights was just gaining traction after Emmeline Pankhurst’s founding of the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) and the motto ‘Deeds not words’. When researching the Maison Dieu’s suffrage history, we came across this newspaper article from July 1909 detailing the performance of Cicely Hamilton’s suffrage play ‘How the Vote was Won’. We have already discussed the details of this, but this article is clear evidence that the play did come to Dover and was named ‘amusing’. 

Whilst we were at the Maison Dieu we came across a Victorian polling booth and ballot boxes, which some of Dover district’s first women voters would have used, such as Vice President of Dover Women’s Suffrage Society, Alice Barlow . Her letter, written with two other local suffragists, was published in the Dover Express in 1909 arguing the ridiculuous nature of disqualifying women from voting on the grounds of sex. You can find her name  on a plaque in the Stone Hall at the Maison Dieu, alongside  Annie Brunyate and Lorna Bomford.

As well as these connections, the Maison Dieu also accommodated many suffrage meetings with visitors such as Lady Frances Balfour, daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Argyll. Frances was at the forefront of women making changes to political roles within government. Her immense influence made her an important visitor to Dover as she resented her political exclusion within her own family.

The Maison Dieu’s connections with the suffrage movement led us to search in the newspaper archives for further evidence of support for women’s rights throughout Dover. We found this image from a mass rally held in Dover in June 1911. In this image the suffragists are wearing medieval costumes, which was a common image throughout the suffrage movement. This was intended to make the issue appear more distant and so that women did not seem like a threat to contemporary gender roles.
