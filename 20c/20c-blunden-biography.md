Edmund Blunden, poet, author and critic, was born on the 1st of November 1896, in London. His sister Charlotte was born three years later at [Sandgate](/placesqz/sandgate-overview), but shortly after this the family had moved to Yalding, near Maidstone where his parents taught at the village school. It is here that Blunden developed his love of the English countryside and appreciation of nature. A reviewer of his 1931 poetry anthology _Poems 1914-1930_ wrote:
<br><br>
'Two influences stand out clearly and unmistakably; that of Kent, his native countryside, and that of the war. Mr Blunden is a thorough Kentishman. That probably is why he succeeds so admirably in recreating the very soul and atmosphere of the southern counties.'[^ref1]

In August 1915, Blunden enlisted in the army and experienced the horrors of trench warfare.  He wrote some poetry of his experiences in WW1, but most of his work came in the decades after the war, including his memoir  _Undertones Of War in 1928_. His poetry focused on the destruction of the French countryside, which reminded him of his native Kent. He also acknowledged that there were moments of happiness even among the slaughter.

On his return from the front, Blunden was stationed in Suffolk, where he met and married Mary Daines. His Parents continued to live in Yalding at Cleave's House during the 1930s and The Cottage, Vicarage Road in the 1940s, so he still had strong ties to the county.[^ref2] 

After the war, and a brief time at Oxford where he struggled to adapt to the life of academia, Blunden decided to move to London where he began a career in literary journalism. It was at this period that he met Siegfried Sassoon, a fellow poet and war survivor who was born in Matfield, Kent and who shared his love of cricket. They became life-long friends. During this time, he was involved in founding the English Reading Society. This new job allowed him to travel globally to places such as Japan, Hong Kong, and South America. 

In 1945, his book _English Villages_ was published, in which he described Yalding:
<br><br>
'And here, among abundance of chestnuts and elms and cedars and acacias, the village streets begin. They are by no means mathematically planned, but that is a general feature of these villages, resulting in rather more of detached beauty than of entire and immediately observable design. Another characteristic is that many of the best houses are concealed, or partly so, beyond high red walls or thick shrubberies of cherry laurel and boxtree, so that it takes time and a good deal of peeping to find out the pleasures of this parish.'[^ref3]

Blunden lived in Tonbridge during his later years where he wrote 'VE Day', which was published after his death in 2021.

He retired from teaching in 1964. He later died in 1974 and was buried in Long Melford, Suffolk.
