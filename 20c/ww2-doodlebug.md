The year 1944 was one of devastating human loss for Kent, in part due to the impact of a newly invented ‘revenge weapon’ (Vergeltungswaffen) used by the Germans. The V-1 flying bomb, also known as the doodlebug because of its erratic movement and the buzzing noise which signalled its arrival overhead, was a flying bomb powered by a jet engine. The heavy bombing of Kent with 2,400 doodlebugs in the Summer of 1944 lead to the period becoming known as ‘Doodlebug Summer’.

Despite its somewhat light-hearted nickname, the doodlebug was a source of great terror for civilians. Tonbridge which was "bang on the routes of several 'bomb lanes' went through a period of anxiety and stress"[^ref1] recording 100 doodlebug incidents[^ref2]. However for others the doodlebug was an object of curiosity and opportunities to view a Doodlebug were given to residents of Herne Bay at Woolworths[^ref2]  and Whitstable at the Auction Mart. Adults were charged 6d and children 3d to view the bomb, with the funds going towards the Fund for the 'few'. [^ref3]  At the bank holiday fete in Canterbury one of the popular side shows was "an almost complete specimen of the Hun's terror weapon",[^ref4]

A map in ‘The Kent Messenger’ from the Summer of 1944 shows the extent of the bombing in the Kent Section of the South East of England, providing a visual explanation for the name ‘Bomb Alley’ that was given to Kent during the Blitz.[^ref2] Kent’s location en route to the more densely populated city of London, which was the Germans’ main target, meant that enemy bombers who ran out of fuel or were shot down before they reached London, as well as any bombs that fell short of their target, would fall on Kent instead. The Roman Catholic Church in Sevenoaks sustained damage from a doodlebug which hit nearby South Park in July 1944.[^ref3]

However, with heavy bombing on the capital massively impacting public morale, the British government decided to leak false information to the Germans in an effort to redirect doodlebugs away from the centre of London towards Kent, and thus minimise civilian deaths.[^ref4] This calculation, as Professor Eric Grove explains, aimed to 'sacrifice lives in the countryside to avoid heavier casualties in London'.[^ref5] Double agents working for the Allies deceived the Germans into thinking the doodlebugs were landing too far north, and the deception was successful in changing the course of the bombs to hit Kent and the south of London instead.

Though the decision to change the path of the bombs saved many lives in London, the ethics of the government’s decision to interfere with the destination of the bombs has been considered highly controversial. It is estimated that doodlebugs killed over 6,000 people in Britain, with the final doodlebug hitting Orpington on March 27th, 1945.[^ref6] Dartford and Sevenoaks were the worst hit towns in Kent, followed by Ramsgate and Folkestone. Along the coast from New Romney to Dover, many doodlebugs were brought down into the sea.[^ref7]
