Reflections in Thanington Churchyard
<br><br>
Behold the tombs, the new-made graves between,    
The house of prayer, the hallowed ground ; I ween    
But few can pass this holy tranquil scene   
Unconscious of its summer-smiling flowers,   
Rejoicing in the light of Godly powers;    
The star-like daisies in perfection seem    
To smile a welcome, each a starlight queen.   
Why come they forth to live but for an hour   
<br><br>
Here in the churchyard then, O man, take heed,    
And strive to learn His lesson, for indeed    
Tis here a man of care can find his way    
To learn that lesson on the churchyard sod.    
Humbled though guided by His loving rod,    
He must reflect, repent, and look to God!   
December 14 1869
