'At half-past two, we drove with Lady Catherine & Lehzen to Piermont House at Broadstairs & payed Princess Sophia Matilda a short visit' - Queen Victoria's Journal, Tuesday 4th October 1836

Princess Victoria visited Broadstairs during the period 1826 to 1836 with her mother the Duchess of Kent, staying frequently at Pierremont (or Pier Mont) House.
Pierremont House was built in 1785 for Thomas Forsyth (1744-1810) of Rutland. It was designed by Samuel Pepys Cockerell, who also designed Gore Court, near Sittingbourne and contained at least 26 bedrooms.[^ref] In May 1820 and again in July 1821, the house was advertised to let as a marine residence for the season, with a 13 acre garden containing shrubberies, hot house, fruit trees and vegetable garden. There was also a billiard room and stabling for eight horses. Tickets to view the residence could be obtained from Mr Barfield at the Library, Broadstairs.[^ref]  In July 1830, the advertisement for the house in the _Morning Post_ gives more detail. The property contained 26 bedrooms, a library, a 100 foot long grapery and melon ground. The Duchess of Kent took the house in 1830 bringing her young daughter Princess Victoria.[^ref] She had piano lessons in the music room which was detached from the main house and local legend has it that on one occasion after being corrected by her music mistress, Victoria shut the piano, locked it and refused to continue.[^ref]  In 1833, H.R.H. Princess Sophia rented Pierremont house from Edward Fletcher for the summer and again in 1838, after the coronation.[^ref]
The house was owned by a Scottish gentleman, Edward Fletcher (c.1762-1846) from at least 1833-1846, but on his death it was auctioned off and parts of the estate sold to build new housing.

Princess Victoria visited the house with her mother the Duchess of Kent as a child. She had piano lessons in the music room which was detached from the main house and local legend has it that on one occasion after being corrected by her music mistress, Victoria shut the piano, locked it and refused to continue.[^ref]

At the end of October 1829, Victoria and her mother left Broadstairs for the Earl of Winchelsea's seat in Kent.[^ref]

Lady Sophia Foy (1780-1845) was staying with the Princess at the time of Princes Victoria's visit. 

Baroness Lehzen (3 October 1784 – 9 September 1870) was her governess. According to Hibbert (2000) Lehzen instilled distrust in Victoria's mind against her mother.

Princess Sophia Matilda 

Princess Sophia Matilda of Gloucester (29 May 1773 – 29 November 1844) was unmarried and 62 years old, Lady Sophia Foy was 56 (Unless it was her daughter) Princess Victoria was 17 and so the short visit may simply have been a curtesy call to an older relative.
