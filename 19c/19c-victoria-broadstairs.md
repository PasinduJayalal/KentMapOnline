'At half-past two, we drove with Lady Catherine & Lehzen to Piermont House at Broadstairs & payed Princess Sophia Matilda a short visit' - _Queen Victoria's Journal_, Tuesday 4th October 1836
<br><br>
Princess Victoria visited Thanet for the first time with her mother the Duchess of Kent in 1824, but it was two years later [check!] before the royal family stayed at [Broadstairs](/dickens/broadstairs-19th-century) where they rented Pierremont (or Pier Mont) House.

Pierremont House had 26 bedrooms, a library, a billiard room, a 13 acre garden containing shrubberies, hot house, fruit trees, vegetable garden, a 100 foot long grapery, melon ground and stabling for eight horses. It was built in 1785 for Thomas Forsyth (1744-1810) of Rutland and was designed by Samuel Pepys Cockerell, who also designed Gore Court, near Sittingbourne.   In the 1820s, it was let for the season as a marine residence and tickets could be obtained to view it from Mr Barfield at the Library, Broadstairs.[^ref] The Duchess of Kent took the house in 1829 bringing her young daughter Princess Victoria.[^ref]

The Duchess of Kent, Princess Victoria and Prince Charles and royal entourage, arrived in Broadstairs on the 1 August 1829 at 7.00 pm. They were greeted with ringing church bells and an amateur band playing national airs on the lawn of Pierremont House. In the evening, the village was partly illuminated to mark the occasion.[^ref] The royal presence caused an "unusual demand for houses" in Broadstairs for the season. [Two weeks later, the Morning Post - Friday 17 July 1829 reports that t] On 17 August 1829, the residents of Broadstairs celebrated the Duchess of Kent's birthday with triumphal arches and illuminations. His Royal Highness, Prince Leopold visited his sister, the Duchess, and the royal party "honour the town with a visit." Three miles away in Ramsgate there are still houses to be let, although there are aristocratic visitors and this Misses Burdett. /19c/19c-burdett-coutts-biography/

Princess Victoria had piano lessons in the music room which was detached from the main house and enjoyed walking along the pier or parade.[^ref]

On the 3 November 1829, Victoria and her mother left Broadstairs, after their three month stay, attended by Lady Catherine Jenkinson, Baroness Lehzen and Sir John Conroy (who had also rented a house in Broadstairs for the season) to visit Eastwell Park, near Ashford, the home of the Earl of Winchelsea, and after this, newspapers locate them at Cobham Hall, the seat of the Earl of Darnley and the Earl of Liverpool (Charles Jenkinon's) home, Buxted Park, Uckfield.[^ref]

In 1833, H.R.H. Princess Sophia rented Pierremont house from Edward Fletcher for the summer and again in 1838, after the coronation.[^ref]
The house was owned by a Scottish gentleman, Edward Fletcher (c.1762-1846) from at least 1833-1846, but on his death it was auctioned off and parts of the estate sold to build new housing.

In 1835, the Duchess took Princess Victoria to Ramsgate for the season, and the fashionable members of society followed them. _Bell's New Weekly Messenger_ mocked the disappointed Broad-starers who stared at all newcomers "to little or no purpose" and advised them to be "content, for they have the Princess Sophia of Gloucester amoug them, and the Earls Aylesford and Dartmouth, and several other Midland Lords and Ladies who, wherever they are, always make point of existing unmixed with baser matter." It was a stinging remark.

Princess Sophia Matilda stayed in Broadstairs at this time.[^ref] In September 1836, the Duchess returned to Pierremont House, as did Princess Sophia?

"It Is well known that for many years past the Isle of Thanet has been the favourite autumnal retreat of the Duchess of Kent and her illustrious daughter, now Queen of England. Thither they regularly went, accompanied, for their ealte staion, by a small retinue, and during the stay throwing aside much of the cumbersome and formal constraints and chilling ceremonials of royalty, they entered into free intercourse with the respectable resident families 'and were constautly to be seen passing, almost unattended along the public streets or parades of the principal towns of the island." Morning Chronicle - Friday 23 June 1837

Lady Sophia Foy (1780-1845) was staying with the Princess at the time of Princes Victoria's visit. 

Baroness Lehzen (3 October 1784 – 9 September 1870) was her governess. According to Hibbert (2000) Lehzen instilled distrust in Victoria's mind against her mother.

Princess Sophia Matilda of Gloucester (29 May 1773 – 29 November 1844) was unmarried and 62 years old, Lady Sophia Foy was 56 (Unless it was her daughter) Princess Victoria was 17 and so the short visit may simply have been a curtesy call to an older relative.
