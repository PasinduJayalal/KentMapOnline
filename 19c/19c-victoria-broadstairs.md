'At half-past two, we drove with Lady Catherine & Lehzen to Piermont House at Broadstairs & payed Princess Sophia Matilda a short visit' - Queen Victoria's Journal, Tuesday 4th October 1836

Pierremont House was built in 1785 for Thomas Forsyth (1744-1810) of Empingham Hall, Rutland and 4 Upper Wimpole Street, London. It was designed by Samuel Pepys Cockerell, the architect who also designed Gore Court, near Sittingbourne.[^ref]

Lady Sophia Foy (1780-1845) was staying with the Princess at the time of Princes Victoria's visit. 

Baroness Lehzen (3 October 1784 – 9 September 1870) was her governess. According to Hibbert (2000) Lehzen instilled distrust in Victoria's mind against her mother.

Princess Sophia Matilda 

Princess Sophia Matilda of Gloucester (29 May 1773 – 29 November 1844) was unmarried and 62 years old, Lady Sophia Foy was 56 (Unless it was her daughter) Princess Victoria was 17 and so the short visit may simply have been a curtesy call to an older relative.
