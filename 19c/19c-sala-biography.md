Author and journalist, George Augustus Sala was born in London in 1828, the son of Madame Sala, a woman of colour. At the age of 11, he was sent to study in Paris, where he stayed at a lodging house with his older “much-dreaded” brother, Frederic.[^ref1] However, in 1840, with anti-British sentiment running high, his mother, fearing war between Britain and France, removed her family from Paris and departed “bag and baggage” to [Dover](19c/19c-dover). 

Sala describes their arrival in England in the winter of 1840:
<br><br>
“There was no Lord Warden Hotel at Dover in those days; and the railway to London although considerable progress had been made in the work, was, in 1841, very far from completion. It was, I think, at a cosy, old-fashioned hostelry by the side of “The Gun”, kept by an old-fashioned worthy named Hipgrave, that we first took up our quarter…”
<br><br>
Hipgrave’s Victoria and Gun Hotel and Commercial Inn, adjoined the Custom House and prided itself on its “comfort, convenience and economy.” It offered accommodation on “extra moderate terms” which was exactly what Madame Sala needed as she had arrived with little money, having spent a considerable sum on the journey.[^ref2]

Widowed and with five children, Madame Sala had suffered from smallpox two years earlier which had affected her eyesight. She received funds from the Royal Society of Musicians to help support her the year earlier.[^ref3] On arriving in Dover, she placed an advertisement in the Dover Telegraph announcing that she had “the honour to acquaint the Nobility, Gentry and her friends, Residents and Visitors in Dover, that she is just returned from Paris, in consequence of the unsettled state of that city, and will remain in Dover during the Winter, for the purpose of giving lessons in singing.”  She was accompanied on the piano by George’s older brother Frederic.[^ref4] In December, Lady Fitzroy Somerset arranged a benefit concert for Madame Sala, which “elicited the warmest applause from a crowded and fashionable audience”.[^ref5]
<br><br>
The family moved into furnished apartments at 64, Snargate Street, which Sala described as “opposite the Heights, the little summer-houses on the gentle slopes of which used to fill me with huge delight.”[^ref6] 

In December, Madame Sala “kindly consented” to act as Miss Wyndham in 'The Culprit', as Mrs Gregory in 'The Two Gregories' and performed arias at the Theatre Royal, 87, Snargate Street [^ref7] which was then being run by Miss Caroline Darling “a tall and attenuated young lady, who was supposed to excel in “pantaloon parts.” [^ref8] 
<br><br>
A month later, Madame Sala and Mrs Reignolds gave a grand ball at the Apollonion Hall with a quadrille band and card room.  Tickets were sold for 6s for the gentlemen and 5 shillings for the ladies.[^ref9] The ball was very popular and was attended by the officers of the garrison as well as the county families from Folkestone, Hythe and Sandgate. Sala recalls that Snargate Street was “blocked with travelling carriages and postchaises” and that his mother made so much money that she was able to equip herself for the London season.[^ref10] 
<br><br>
Sala’s older brother Charles who was “anxious to enact Hamlet the Dane ” performed at the Theatre Royal in February 1841 [^ref11] The theatre which was “in a simply deplorable condition”[^ref12] lacked suitable costumes and Charles had to design a suit of armour out of pasteboard and tinfoil.[^ref13]

Sala remembers observing the funeral cortege an assistant surgeon in the 54th foot from his drawing room window in Snargate Street: “the dead man’s cocked hat and sword lying on the Union Jack which was the pall of his coffin”. [p.143] Dr Everard had been killed in a brawl outside the Grand Shaft, at the end of December. Dover Telegraph and Cinque Ports General Advertiser - Saturday 02 January 1841

Sala also remembers meeting the Duke of Wellington, who was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and residing at Walmer Castle, walking down Snargate Street, with Lord Fitzroy Somerset, afterwards Lord Raglan. The Duke patted Sala on the head and “hoped that I was good to my mother”.’ Sala believes the Duke was “unconsciously the direct cause of my adopting the profession of journalism.”
<br><br>
During his time at Dover, the thirteen-year-old Sala wrote a novel which was subsequently lost entitled “Jemmy Jenkins: or, the Adventures of a Sweep”, revealing his early ambitions as a writer. 

Leaving Dover, for London, with the proceeds made from the ball, Sala recalls “we were fain to be very frugal in our journey to the metropolis.” They travelled from Dover to Canterbury by stage-coach, after which, Madame Sala and Charles took a postchaise to Herne Bay; “and we children followed in an anomalous vehicle drawn by two horses which .was half a coach and half a fly; the driver of the vehicle seeming himself somewhat diffident in defining its character. He spoke of it as “conveyance.”” At Herne Bay steam packets sailed to London Bridge Wharf on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for a fare of 5 or 6 shillings. Dover Telegraph and Cinque Ports General Advertiser - Saturday 28 November 1840
<br><br>
Sala admits that he remembers nothing of Herne Bay “save a prodigiously protracted pier, very soon to be immortalised in the pages of the not yet nascent Punch.” 

Attracting the notice of Charles Dickens, Sala began to write for Household Words and in 1856 travelled to Russia as a special correspondent. It was during this time that he wrote “Journey due North”. Dickens embargoed the work which caused some bitterness between the two men. However in 1858, Charles Dickens removed the embargo and Sala sent it to Richard Bentley who agreed to publish it. 
<br><br>
Sala read a review of his book at the Lord Warden Hotel, Dover on his return from the continent. Having decided to spend the day “at the venerable Kentish watering place” after a rather rough passage from Calais he “read and re-read it, quite forgetting my breakfast.” The reviewer had described the book as “a bundle of impertinences” [p391] and insinuated that Sala was “an idiot, a libeller and a snob”. The review worked in Sala’s favour and as a result of demand a second edition was produced.
