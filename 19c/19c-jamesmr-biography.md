A tenuous Kent link perhaps as James moved to Great Livermere, Suffolk aged 3. His father was a clergyman and took up a new post there.

A number of James's stories have been adapted for television and film. Following the 1968 adaptation of Whistle and I'll Come to You (1968) directed by Jonathan Miller and starring Michael Hordern as Professor Parkin, the BBC broadcast the series A Ghost Story for Christmas between 1971 and 1978, dramatising five MR James stories The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral (1971), A Warning to the Curious (1972), Lost Hearts (1973), The Treasure of Abbot Thomas (1974) and The Ash Tree (1975). More recent BBC adaptations are A View From a Hill (2005), Number 13 (2006), Whistle and I'll Come to You (2010), The Tractate Middoth (2013) and Martin's Close (2019).

James's story Casting the Runes inspired the film Night of the Demon (1957).

A prolific academic, James largely dismissed his tales. 'These stories are meant to please and amuse us,' he writes in his essay Ghosts -- Treat Them Gently (Evening News – 17th April 1931). 'If they do so, well; but, if not, let us relegate them to the top shelf and say no more about it.'

Despite this reticence, for which his stories are famous, he is widely known and referred to as the 'master of the ghost story'.

On February 23rd 2012 the Royal Mail released a stamp featuring James as part its ‘Britons of Distinction’ series
