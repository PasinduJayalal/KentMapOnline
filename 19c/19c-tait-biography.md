In March 1848, Archibald Campbell Tait, the headmaster of Rugby School visited Broadstairs on the advice of his doctor. Tait who had been chosen to succeed Dr Thomas Arnold as headmaster at Rugby six years earlier, was severely exhausted. On his appointment, “his friends scarcely knew whether to congratulate him or not upon the perilous inheritance”; [p111, Davidson, 1891] the school was overcrowded, and the funding system left little money for the expansion of teaching staff. [p.116, Davidson]  Although Tait described his time at the school as “a very happy and a very bright life”.[^ref1: Catharine and Craufurd Tait, wife and son of Archibald Cambpell, archbishop of Canterbury : a memoir by Tait, Archibald Campbell, 1811-1882; Benham, William, 1831-1910] – it was during this time that he met and married his wife -  it was also one of hard work and anxiety, which took its toll on his health. When he fell ill in the spring, the school feared for his life: “expecting that any moment the chapel bell might toll” [p117] Tait’s illness was exacerbated by his sense of duty to the school and he complained: “I must return to my work or soon I shall think there is nothing in the world so interesting as the beating of my own heart.” It was seen as imperative that he should be removed from the stresses of Rugby. Dr Hodson, who predicated a “rapid decline” suggested the soft air of Beaumaris, whilst Dr Babington, who had treated Tait before, recommended the bracing air of Broadstairs. Tait took Babington’s advice and “The remaining weeks of the holidays were spent there with the two little ones, in a small but not very comfortable lodging.  But what were inconveniences in comparison with the glad feeling of returning health”.
