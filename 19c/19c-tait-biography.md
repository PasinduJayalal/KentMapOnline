In March 1848, Archibald Campbell Tait, the headmaster of Rugby School visited Broadstairs on the advice of his doctor. Tait who had been chosen to succeed Dr Thomas Arnold as headmaster at Rugby six years earlier, was severely exhausted. On his appointment to the post, “his friends scarcely knew whether to congratulate him or not upon the perilous inheritance”. [^ref1] The school was overcrowded, and the funding system left little money to expand the teaching staff. [^ref2]  Although Tait described his time at the school as “a very happy and a very bright life”[^ref3] (it was during this time that he met and married his wife), it was also one of hard work and anxiety, which took its toll on his health. When he fell ill in the spring, the school feared for his life: “expecting that any moment the chapel bell might toll.” [^ref4] Tait’s illness was exacerbated by his sense of duty to the school and he complained: “I must return to my work or soon I shall think there is nothing in the world so interesting as the beating of my own heart.”[^ref5] It was seen as imperative that he should be removed from the stresses of Rugby. Dr Hodson, who predicated a “rapid decline” suggested the soft air of Beaumaris, whilst Dr Babington, who had treated Tait before, recommended the bracing air of Broadstairs.[^ref6]

Broadstairs at this period was gaining a reputation as a health resort among those seeking a more restful experience than could be had at the busy sea-bathing towns of Margate and Ramsgate. It was described as a place where “a thoroughly respectable family can, without the risk of being styled vulgar, retire for a month's genteel repose”[^ref7] (although its attitude to mixed bathing had raised the eyebrows of some visitors who complained about the “scanty coverings”[^ref8] of the female bathers and the scandalous proximity of the bathing machines).[^ref9] Tait took Babington’s advice and “The remaining weeks of the holidays were spent there with the two little ones, in a small but not very comfortable lodging.  But what were inconveniences in comparison with the glad feeling of returning health”.[^ref10]

Almost twenty years later, Tait, now Bishop of London, and in his mid-fifties was “so knocked up” after attending the Pan-Anglican Conference at Lambeth that “he was obliged to take another month of entire rest”. The conference, which was the first of the Lambeth Conferences, was held over 4 days and was attended by 76 bishops.[^ref11] After the Conference, Tait took lodgings at the North Foreland Lodge near Broadstairs to enjoy once again the sea breezes that had revived him in his earlier career.[^ref12] It was during this visit, that a neighbouring house called Stonehouse, came on the market and Tait decided to buy it. It was to become a favourite retreat of the Tait family and they usually stayed here for around 6-8 weeks a year. It was a sizable property which would have required a large staff of servants and would have been suitable for entertaining.

In the following autumn, the Taits were staying at Stonehouse, when they received the news of the death of Charles Longley, Archbishop of Canterbury. Shortly after a message from Queen Victoria arrived offering Tait the archbishopric. His sister, Lady Wake recalls: “A week passed without another word to Stonehouse ; then one morning the sound of wheels was heard, and in another moment Mr Fisher, the Bishop's chaplain, appeared, bringing a letter from the Prime Minister containing the expected appointment.” Tait accepted with “a deep feeling of responsibility” [^ref13]

What followed was an exhausting round or engagements as Tait’s diary testifies:
<br><br>
'Confirmation at Smeeth. Visited the new schools. Got on to Tonbridge  Wells, in a snowy night, in time for a large dinner-party of clergy at Mr. Hoare's. Great  Confirmation  on 11th  at Tonbridge Wells, and a second equally large at Tonbridge. Drove to Tonbridge after a huge luncheon party, and in the dark drove fifteen  miles from Tonbridge to  Mr. Talbot's at Falconhurst, where most kindly received. Met many people at dinner. Confirmed next day at Penshurst. Great luncheon of  clergy and others. Returned in dark. Another dinner-party.On  Saturday 13th confirmed at Edenbridge. Great luncheon of many, clergy and others. Confirmed in  afternoon at Westerham. Drove to Colonel Ward's lovely place, Squerries. After tea started for a drive in the dark over the hills. Got to  Addington at 9.15. Very thankful to have got through a heavy week so well, notwithstanding  the perpetual singing in my ears.'[^ref14]

Although Tait was enthusiastically committed to the role, his health remained fragile and he was prone to bouts of exhaustion.  Lady Wake wrote: “The interest of his new duties as Archbishop carried him on far beyond his strength. He always considered he had done enough to recruit his health by spending a few bright weeks with his friends in Scotland, finishing the autumn at Stonehouse.” 

Tait wrote: 'the change to Canterbury had certainly brought no relaxation of work.  The Confirmations were pressing. All seemed to go on prosperously, and my  strength to be equal to my  duties. But the bow, it would seem, had been overstrung.' Just over a year after his appointment to the Archbishopric, Tait suffered another health scare. 
<br><br>
[On  Monday,  November  15th]  I had been to a diocesan meeting at Ashford, and in the evening spoke for one of the Missionary Societies. Next  morning I had to  hurry to London for the Ecclesiastical Commission, and I think for a meeting of the Charterhouse, then down to the Isle of Thanet by the evening train. Next day  was spent quietly at home [at  Stonehouse], but correspondence was accumulating, and I believe ninety letters had to be superintended and despatched by that post I  was very tired in the evening, but next morning  [November  18] I rose fresh as usual. I remember going into my wife's room and finding her reading the Bible with  the children. I warned them not to work their mother too hard. I remember also looking out of the window on the bright frosty morning, and anticipating a day of  comparative rest I returned to my dressing-room, but I had not finished dressing when I fell prostrate and senseless on the floor."
