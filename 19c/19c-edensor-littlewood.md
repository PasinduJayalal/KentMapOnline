'Before creation, God did just pure mathematics. Then He thought it would be a pleasant change to do some applied.' - John Edensor Littlewood.
<br><br>
John Edensor Littlewood, mathematician was born in Rochester on 9 June 1885. He lived with his parents Sylvia and Edward Thornton Littlewood at 4, Clevedon Terrace, Roebuck Lane.[^ref1] His father who had been Ninth Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge three years earlier, was a mathematics master at Rochester Cathedral Grammar School.[^ref2]

The family moved to Dover in 1887, where his father took up a post at Dover College. It was here that John's two brothers Martin and Leslie were born. His parents took in boarders, so home life would have been lively with babies and young boys.[^ref3] His uncle Francis taught/attended Dover College in 1890 but tragically drowned (where) two years later. His brother drowned in a lake.

In 1891, John and his siblings went to live with their grandparents whilst their parents prepared for a move to Africa and in the following year the family moved to Wynberg in the Cape Colony. His father took up a post as headmaster at the High School there, where he continued to teach until 1918.  John spent the next eight years in Africa where he went to school and attended some lectures at Cape Town University, despite his very young age. He said of his childhood: "I had a very happy childhood among mountains, the ocean, and a beautiful climate".[^ref4]

At the age of 15, John returned to England to live with his uncle who was a master at St Paul's School in London, where he himself became a pupil.  John thrived under the tutelage of mathematics master Francis Sowerby Macaulay and in 1903 he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge. He described his time at Cambridge: "To be in the running for Senior Wrangler one had to spend two-thirds of the time parctising how to solve difficult problems against time".[^ref5] It was something that came easily to him.

In 1912, he published the first of a series of papers with G.H. Hardy, a collaboration which was to last 35 years. The two mathematicians published articles on Diophantine analysis, divergent series summation, Fourier series, the Riemann zeta function and the distribution of primes.

During the First World War, John served as a second lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery working on and furthering research into ballistics. He was able to predict with accuracy missile trajectories.[^ref6]

In 1938, Littlewood began working with Mary Cartwright on non-linear differential equations to advance research into radio enginnering as a result of an appeal from the Radio Research Board. They spent 20 years working on equations such as van der Pol's equation.

Sir Henry Dale described John as "the man most likely to storm and smash a really deep and formidable problem; there was no one else who could command such a combination of insight, technique and power".[^ref] He died on the 6 September 1877 in Cambridge.
