Jessie May Aldington, author of ‘Love Letters that caused a Divorce’ and 'Meg of the Salt Pans', was born in Hythe in 1872. She was the daughter of Charles Godfree, a Sergeant Major in the Army Hospital Corps, who was stationed at the Hythe School of Musketry and Eliza nee Burden, the daughter of a Rolvenden shoemaker.  The family moved frequently due to Charles work, living at Hythe, Rolvenden, Bermuda and Portsea.

By 1881, the family had settled in [Dover](/19c/19c-dover/)at 14, Liverpool St, which was in the St James area of the town. Jessie lived here until her father retired from the army and became the licensee of the Bell and Anchor Inn in Sandwich.

When her parents and younger siblings moved to London, Jessie remained with her two aunts, Isabel and Catherine, at the Bell and Anchor, and it was here that she met her future husband Albert Aldington, a [Dover](/19c/19c-dover/)  solicitor, whom she married in a 'shot gun wedding' in 1891. The couple had two children, Edward and Margery.

Moving to a large yellow brick house at 5, Godwyne Road, Dover, the Aldingtons lived a comfortable life, sending their son Richard to Mr Sweetman’s Seminary for Young Gentlemen at St Margaret’s Bay, where he learned French and Latin, before attending Dover College. 

Albert was a 'gentle studious docile man' with a library of around 2,000 books including Keats, Harrison Ainsworth, Sir Walter Scott and Oscar Wilde. He wrote two books, one of which was the _Queen’s Preferment_ published in 1896. In contrast, Jessie was outgoing and energetic, enjoying golf, cycling and watching cricket. Beneath this vitality was a temper, and her daughter Margery said:  “she flourished and thrived on a first class “row” at least once a week, but it shattered the rest of us” (p.2) Richard remembers passing the “sad housemaids” whitening the steps on his way to school.

In 1905, Jessie's published her first book _Love Letters that caused a Divorce_ a series of letters detailing the temptations of Kitty Yorke. It was a fairly short book which could be read in half an hour.  Richard “She caused the windows of (I think) the _Kentish Express_ to be filled with copies of an incredible work coquettishly entitled _Love Letters that Caused a Divorce_. This work was designed to extinguish Marie Corelli and Elinor Glyn, but unluckily failed to do so.” (p3) 
'it is evidently written by a woman who thoroughly understands her own sex, for all the inconsistencies of the feminine character are clearly shown, as are the struggles of Kitty to stifle this illicit love'.


Richard, wrote of his parents: 'though literate, he wrote so badly. Mother’s novels, though hideously vulgar and illiterate, have much more vitality.' (3)

He had a poor head for business and the family ended up in debt. 

His mother was acquainted with professional writers.
