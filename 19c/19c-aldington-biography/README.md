Jessie May Aldington, author of ‘Love Letters that caused a Divorce’ and 'Meg of the Salt Pans', which was set in East Kent, was born in Hythe in 1872. She was the daughter of Charles Godfree, a Sergeant Major in the Army Hospital Corps, who was temporarily stationed at the Hythe School of Musketry, and Eliza Burden, the daughter of a Rolvenden shoemaker.  The family moved frequently due to Charles work, living at Hythe, Rolvenden, Bermuda and Portsea.

By 1881, the family had settled in [Dover](/19c/19c-dover/) at 14, Liverpool St, which was in the St James area of the town. Jessie lived here until her father retired from the army and became the licensee of the Bell and Anchor Inn in Sandwich.

When her parents and younger siblings moved to London, Jessie remained with her two aunts, Isabel and Catherine, at the Bell and Anchor, and it was here that she met her future husband Albert Aldington, a [Dover](/19c/19c-dover/)  solicitor, whom she married in a 'shot gun wedding' in 1891. The couple had two children, Edward (the poet Richard Aldington) and Margery.

Moving to a large yellow brick house, no. 5, Godwyne Road, Dover, the Aldingtons lived a comfortable life, sending their son to Mr Sweetman’s Seminary for Young Gentlemen at St Margaret’s Bay, where he learned French and Latin, before attending Dover College. Richard remembers passing the “sad housemaids” whitening the steps on his way to school.

Albert was a 'gentle studious docile man' with a library of around 2,000 books including Keats, Harrison Ainsworth, Sir Walter Scott and Oscar Wilde. He wrote two books, one of which was the _Queen’s Preferment_ published in 1896. In contrast, Jessie was outgoing and energetic, enjoying golf, cycling and watching cricket. However, beneath this vitality was a tempestous nature;  her daughter Margery said:  “she flourished and thrived on a first class “row” at least once a week, but it shattered the rest of us” (p.2) 

Albert, who was involved in the British Homes Assurance Company [Dover Express - Friday 19 April 1901] which allowed people to “secure a roof over their heads free from landlord’s control”. Dov Exp Friday 26 April 1901, began buying and selling property, possibly with the involvement of Jessie's brother and the family moved to Warwick Lodge, Walmer, a larger and more modern house. 

In 1905, Jessie's published her first book _Love Letters that caused a Divorce_ a series of letters detailing the temptations of Kitty Yorke and convinced the local newspaper office to fill its windows with copies. Richard wrote: "This work was designed to extinguish Marie Corelli and Elinor Glyn, but unluckily failed to do so.” (p3) Reviews described it as 'evidently written by a woman who thoroughly understands her own sex, for all the inconsistencies of the feminine character are clearly shown, as are the struggles of Kitty to stifle this illicit love'. Richard, wrote of his parents: 'though literate, he wrote so badly. Mother’s novels, though hideously vulgar and illiterate, have much more vitality.'(3)

In the summer of 1906, the Aldingtons bought Rothiemay at St Margaret’s of Cliffe, (p.24 Whelpton) where Albert became Master of the Foreland Lodge of Freemasons. In Ursula Bloom’s memoir _Holiday Mood_ she recalls “Aldington's people were well off, and had a comfortable house in which they entertained quite a lot.” [p25, Whelpton] Their lifestyle was described as Bohemian. However, after making some poor business decisions, Rotheimay had to be sold and Jessie and the children moved to Sandwich. During this period, Jessie May wrote short stories for _Cassell's Magazine_, _The Story-teller_, _The English Illustrated Magazine_ and _The Red Magazine_.

 _Meg of the Salt Pans_ which was described as her best work, was published in 1909. The story begins in a an East Kent inn where the villagers gather to discuss local and national affairs.  Meg "a child of nature" helps her grandmother, run the inn, attracting the attention of two beaux: a young scientific farmer educated at Wynne (Wye) College and a dashing Lance-Corporal Jones, of the Dragoon Guards, which are stationed at Canterbury. A review of the book praises the authoress who 'has given us several excellent pen pictures of Kentish people — people that we seem to know without being able to actually recognise'. [Dover Express - Friday 11 June 1909] Although place names were obscured, it is likely that Sandport is Sandwich, and that the book draws on Jessie's own experiences living at the Bell and Anchor. Meg makes an unhappy marriage with the Lance-Corporal. In the same year, Jessie May's second daughter Joan was christened at Sandwich. After the birth of Joan, the family moved to London. 
 
During the war, Albert worked for the Ministry of Munitions whilst Jessie ran the Mermaid Inn at Rye, which became a haunt of [Dame Ellen Terry](/20c/20c-terry-biography), Lord Alfred Douglas, E.F. Benson and Rupert Brooke. [Ford Madox Ford](/20c/20c-fordmadoxford-biography/) also visited for dinner. 

had come to an end and he had taken on what amounted to not much more than clerical work in Malcolm Hilbery’s Chambers in Holborn

The war

After the war, the Aldingtons moved to Rye. Albert applied for a job as Town Clerk of Blackpool.
