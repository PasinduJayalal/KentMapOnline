To my GENEROUS and OBLIGING FRIENDS OF THE County of KENT.
GENTLEMEN, .This Play was both design'd and finish'd in Your County, and therefore comes for Protection to the Place of its Nativity. It drags not a sluggish and unwilling Pace, as timorous of its Reception, and the hardiness of its fate; but pants for its native air, where it was brought forth with pleasure, and flies to the good treatment of your experience’d hospitality” Introduction to The fair Quaker of Deal: or, the humours of the navy, 1710.

Little is known about Charles Shadwell’s birth or childhood, but it is most likely that he was born in London. He was the son of Thomas Shadwell (c.1640–1692), playwright, poet laureate and historiographer and the celebrated Restoration actor Anne Gibbs.  Thomas and Anne married sometime between 1663 and 1664  and had at least 4 children between 1671 and 1686 so Charles’s birth has been dated to around this period.  

Charles’s father Thomas, whose first play The Sullen Lovers (1668) was a runaway success became noted among court circles and attracted the patronage of poet and courtier Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset and Lord Chamberlain.  The two men both enjoyed life to excess and Nell Gwynn described them drinking ale together all day. Thomas received regular sums of money from the Earl as “without your Lord’s generosity I could not have subsisted till now”. 

Thomas was appointed poet laureate and historiographer at the Glorious Revolution in 1688 for which he received £300 per annum for the role. He did not find writing poetry easy and wrote “a series of tedious laureate poems”.  His plays were a little more successful, although he received criticism from both from his rival John Dryden and Samuel Pepys. [ODNB]. Dorset’s receipts reveal that the Earl spent a lot of money on rich food such as oysters and wine, which no doubt Thomas was able to enjoy under his patronage. In May 1692 Thomas complained of “a very painful fitt of the Gout” which had been brought on by this rich living. Thomas began to take opium to ease the pain and died in November of that year after taking an overdose of opium, to which he had become addicted.   

Charles’s mother Anne who had performed in at least two of Thomas’s plays as well as two by the female playwright, [Aphra Behn](/18c/17c-behn-biography) now had to support the family. She published Thomas’s last play The Volunteers with a dedication to queen  Ann in 1693 in which she wrote; “The little wit of our poor family as well as the best part of the subsistence perished with my husband; so that we have not where withall, worthily to express our great Acknowledgement due for the Support and Favour, we have already received.” Not much is known about Ann after 1705, although she retained an interest in the rents for the Dorset Garden Theatre.

It is uncertain where Charles received his education but Charles’s father was educated at Caius College, Cambridge and his brother John was educated at University College and All Souls’ college, Oxford. Charles entered the army and served under Major-General Newton, Governor of Londonderry during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-15). Newton was in charge of the foot guards at Rota, near Cadiz in 1702 with 300 men in garrison and “several pieces of cannon”. 

In 1710 Charles is recorded as the supervisor of the excise in Kent and it was at during this time that he wrote his play “The Fair Quaker of Deal” which he dedicated to his friends of Kent. He jokes in the dedication that “to incorporate You, by name into one Body, would require a College of Heralds to order the precedence” suggesting that he had more than one influential supporter. Lionel Cranfield Sackville (1688-1765), the son of Charles Sackville, the 6th Earl of Dorset who had been his father’s patron, was the Governor of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinq Ports from 1708-12, at the same time that Charles Shadwell was supervisor of the excise for Kent, and it was possibly his family connections which enabled him to obtain this position. French and Spanish prisoners from the War of the Spanish Succession were also imprisoned at the castle during this period so it is possible that Charles could have been stationed here with his regiment earlier than 1710 (A Charles Shadwell marries Amy Power at Dover St James the Apostle on 20 August 1704, which was the church used by the army at this period. )
