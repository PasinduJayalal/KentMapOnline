**Testing**

Chemist, Dr [Robert Plot](/17c/17c-robert-plot) wrote to Dr Charlett from Rochester in 1693 to tell him: "the greatest rarity I have met with has been here, viz. a medicine for the bite of a mad dog". The medicine consisted of being dipped in the salt water below the bridge "without fig-leaves" by two lewd fellows.[^ref1]
