The sea is calm to-night. The tide is full, the moon lies fair Upon the straits ; — on the French coast the light Gleams and is gone ; the cliffs of England stand, Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay. Come to the window, sweet is the night-air ! Only, from the long line of spray Where the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land, Listen ! you hear the grating roar Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling - _Dover Beach_ by Matthew Arnold

But there was a trail of tea from a punctured dollop, and a two-way track of planks as evidence of a large and carefully-planned run.”
