Lullingstone Roman Villa is situated near the village of Eynsford, in the Darent Valley. It was unearthed during archaeological excavations
undertaken by Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Wells Meates F.S.A. and Ernest Greenfield in the late 1940s to early 1960s.[^ref1] It is an example of 

Although originally from Hereford, Meates had visited Kent at the age of 11 staying with the Langfords at Smith Farm, Smarden. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1919 and served in India, Rangoon, Burma and Ireland. 
<br><br>
During the Second World War, Meates served in the Heavy Anti Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, and was involved in the retreat from Dunkirk and the Seige of Malta.[^ref2] His final posting was Sandwich from 1944 until 1945. 
<br><br>
After the war he retired from service life and took up archaeology.[^ref3] His first excavation was at Farningham, near Sevenoaks in 1947. 

Meates began digging at Lullingstone in 1949 and over the next 13 years uncovered a villa complex including a villa, a granary, shrine, kitchen and a temple-mausoleum. The villa was built during the Roman occupation of Britain, approximately AD 80-100, and would have been a luxurious family home. 
<br><br>
Excavations revealed a remarkable mosaic floor with scenes depicting the Rape of Europa by Jupiter in the form of a bull, Bellerephon mounted on the winged horse Pegasus spearing the Chimera, and representations of the four seasons.[^ref4]  Two busts made from Carrara marble were also discovered in a sealed chamber. Meates thought that one was the Emperor Antoninus Pius (138-161), although later scholars suggest these are governor Pertinax and his father Publius Helvius Successus.

Meates began giving talks about his discoveries illustrated by lantern slides.[^ref5] He became a member of Kent Archaeological Society and in 1951, was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was the President of the Crayford Manor House Historical and Archaeology Society and founded the Darent Valley Archaeological Research Group.[^ref6] 
<br><br>
In 1955, he published _Lullingstone Roman Villa_ which the _Illustrated London News_ described as a 'fascinating book' for anyone interested in 'archaeology, history and detection all rolled into one'.[^ref7]  At the eighth annual dig dinner in 1957, Meates joked that he hoped that the owner of Lullingstone Castle, Sir Oliver Hart Dyke would join in the next dig on the hillside at the back of the Roman villa and that he would give him a trowel.[^ref8] 
<br><br>
In 1958, the diggers discovered a Romano-British funerary temple dating from around A.D. 300. The inner chamber was adorned with fine plaster wall paintings which contained the Christian symbol Chi-Rho (forming the first two letters of Christ’s name in Greek, chi (χ) and rho (ρ)), evidence of Romano-British Christianity. [^ref9] Beneath this were the burials in lead coffins of a man and woman. One coffin had been robbed of its lead in antiquity. Among the grave goods were 30 draughtsmen, 15 red, 15 white; also forks, spoons and glass utensils.[^ref10]

Meates died on the 9 July 1985 at The Gate House, Lullingstone Castle.
