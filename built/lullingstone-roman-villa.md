Lullingstone Roman Villa is situated in Lullingstone, near the village of Eynsford, in the Darent Valley. It was unearthed during archaeological excavations
undertaken by Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Wells Meates F.S.A. and Ernest Greenfield in the late 1940s to early 1960s.[^ref1] The villa was built during the Roman occupation of Britain, approximately AD 80-100, and would have been a luxurious family home.

Although originally from Hereford, Meates had visited Kent in 1911 when he stayed with the Langfords at Smith Farm, Smarden. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and served in India, Rangoon, Burma and Ireland before the second world war. During the war, he served in the Heavy Anti Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, and was involved in the retreat from Dunkirk and the Seige of Malta.[^ref2] His final posting was Sandwich from 1944-1945, after which he retired from service life and took up archaeology.[^ref3] His first excavation was at Farningham, near Sevenoaks in 1947 and after this Lullingstone in 1949. He became a member of Kent Archaeological Society and in 1951, was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was the President of the Crayford Manor House Historical and Archaeology Society and founded the Darent Valley Archaeological Research Group.[^ref4]  Greenfield 

Meates and Greenfield began digging at Lullingstone shortly after the war.  

Excavations revealed a remarkable mosaic floor with scenes depicting the Rape of Europa by Jupiter in the form of a bull, Bellerephon mounted on the winged horse Pegasus spearing the Chimera, and representations of the four seasons.[^ref5] Two busts made from Carrara marble were also discovered in a sealed chamber, including one of Emperor Antoninus Pius (138-161). A headless bust of a woman "in fine draperies" was also discovered. [^ref6]

villa complex including a villa with rich mosaic tiled floors, 
a granary, shrine, kitchen, mausoleum and what is thought to be a cult room, in the cellar. It had a block of four rooms fronted by a corridor, 
with wings at either end, and a deep cellar under the north wing (on the right-hand side)[^2]

In about 360 AD the northern rooms of the villa were converted into a Christian chapel with fine plaster wall paintings. 
[^3] This creation of a house-church contained wall paintings which made this villa unique to others found in the area, 
as they are the only known paintings in Roman Britain that contain clear Christian symbolism, which is evidence of Romano-British Christianity. 
Although the surviving elements of the scenes depicted are fragmentary, enough remains to suggest a large Chi-Rho - an early Christian symbol 
formed by the first two letters of Christ’s name in Greek, chi (χ) and rho (ρ) - was painted on the south wall. [^4]

**Archaeology in Kent today**
In 1989 a team of 12 archaeologists and a Conservation Architect were put together to create Kent’s first Country Archaeologist, 
this team now work to care for the county’s heritage. Some of their work includes assessing development areas for archaeological potential and ensuring that any 
remains are treated appropriately, maintaining the Historic Environment Record database, advising on listed and historic buildings, and carrying out a range of 
projects designed to ensure Kent’s heritage is cared for, recorded, and promoted. [^1] The Central Excavation Unit of English Heritage undertook a small-scale excavation at Lullingstone car park.

Meates died on the 9 July 1985 at The Gate House,Lullingstone Castle.
