“Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.” The Battle of Britain Memorial situated on top of the White Cliffs at Capel-le-Ferne, near Folkestone, commemorates 'The Few'.

Many convalescent homes were established in Kent, with its temperate seaside climate and relatively easy access to London. These institutions aimed to support recuperating patients, often drawn from urban hospitals.

Kent is not only the garden of England, it is also the first landing site of Christianity in Britain. St Augustine began his mission to convert the Britons to Christianity in Canterbury.

The Invicta Park Barracks which currently houses 36 Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers would seem an unlikely place to have a connection with two Victorian literary heroes: Alfred Lord Tennyson and Edward Lear.

While Kent had fewer Turkish baths than many northern counties, they were no less interesting than those built elsewhere. Many well-known people used them including F C Burnand, Wilkie Collins, Edward Linley Sambourne and George Grossmith.

Throughout History, Dover Castle has been used as a highly fortified military garrison to protect Britain’s shores from invaders. Its secret network of underground tunnels were vital in the Evacuation of Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo) and in the key deception operations of the Second World War.
