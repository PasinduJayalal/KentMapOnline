Canterbury has a long history of theatrical entertainment. Between AD 80–90, the Romans built an amphitheatre in the St. Margaret’s Street area where spectators could sit on a gravel bank to enjoy the performances.[^ref1] In the 3rd century, a ‘D’ shaped, Flavian style (AD201-300) amphitheatre was built in the same location, which could seat around 3,000.[^ref2] 
<br><br>
By Anglo Saxon times, the amphitheatre along with many of the other city's buildings had decayed. 

St Augustine and Church dramas 

In AD597, Saint Augustine landed in Kent and converted many to Christianity. 

Theodore of Tarsus, who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 668-690, banned all wandering players and condemned folk plays. He issued ecclesiastical laws condemning [Hoodening](/19c/19c-hoodening/) performances, most popular in East Kent around Christmastime. 

Around AD 1180, Canterbury’s Guild Hall was built on the corner of the High Street and Guildhall Street. Although, mainly used for municipal purposes, it occasionally held musical events. 

By the 15th/16th century, Liturgical dramas were performed all over Britain. 

 ‘Miracle’ plays recounted the lives of saints, while ‘Mystery cycles’ staged stories from the Bible, both performed on wagons.  

Between 1491 – 1520, a church warden from the parish of St Dunstan’s noted; 
<br><br>
“Canterbury has it’s own pageant of St. Thomas, with one hundred billmen and bowmen preceding a pageant wagon. On it, stood the figures of St Thomas, with a mechanical moving head and a hidden bag of blood, four boy knights, with splendidly gilded armour.”                                        
                                                              
Christopher (Kit) Marlowe, Tudor spy and playwright, was born at 57, St George's Street in 1564 and attended the King's school from 1578. In 1592, he visited Canterbury to see his play 'The Jew of Malta' performed at the Guildhall and whilst staying in the city, got into a fight with William Corkine, a musician from the cathedral, at the Cheker of Hope Inn. The inn which also served as a theatre venue, had a galleried courtyard and was surrounded by two floors which could accommodate up to 100 pilgrims. It is mentioned in the fifeenth century ‘Tale of Beryn’ and was also known as the ‘Chaucer Inn’. 

John ‘Bileous' Bale (1495-1563), famed for his vitriolic language attacking the Catholic church, wrote 'King John' which it is argued is the earliest historical drama in English.[^ref] (Brown, Hutchinson and Irwin _Written City_) It was probably performed at St Stephens in 1538. 

[John Lyly](/16c/16c-lyly-biography/) (c.1553-1606), whose father owned the 'Splayed Eagle' near Canterbury Cathedral, may have been born in the city. He ran the first theatre in Blackfriars, London and was known for his euphuistic style, which was emulated by another Canterbury playwright, Stephen Gosson (1554-1624), who was christened in St.George’s parish. None of Gosson's plays survive, but he later became vehemently opposed to the theatre, writing ‘The School Of Abuse, Conteining a pleasant invective against Poets, Pipers, Plaiers, Jesters and such like Caterpillars of a Commonwealth’ in 1579. In it he argued that the theatre ‘fostered social evils’ and that 'every Wanton and his paramour, every man and his Mistresse, every John and his Joan, every knave and his queane' were corrupted there on the Sabbath.

Strolling or Wandering Players, considered ‘vagabonds’ by law, and without patronage from a noblemen or royalty, toured fairgrounds and race meetings presenting a mixture of acrobatics, drama and songs. The Burghmote book in 1595 notes: 
<br><br>
“....there shall not be any playes enterludes tragedies or comedies be played or players suffered to playe within this Cittie on any Sabaothe days nor above twoe dayes together at any tyme.” 
<br><br>
When the Plague hit London in 1603 and the London theatres closed, actors fled to the provinces; performing in Canterbury, Faversham, Maidstone, Dover, New Romney and Lydd.

The English Civil War 1642 – 1646 stopped theatre completely. After the war, The Puritans still suppressed theatre; players were seized and punished and buildings demolished. 

[Aphra Behn](/17c/17c-behn-biography/) (1640?-1689), (or Eaffrey Johnson), playwright and author of _Oroonoko or the Royal Slave_, was born in Harbledown around 1640. During the 1660’s she wrote ‘The Forc’d Marriage’ for the Duke’s Company under Thomas Betterton, actor and manager. The Duke’s Company was one of two theatre companies (the other, King’s) and allowed to perform complete dramas after the Restoration.  Behn staged nineteen plays including ‘The Amorous Prince’ (1671) and ‘The Young King’ (1679) and most likely contributed to more. A theatrical performance of 'Oroonoko' adapted for the stage by Thomas Southerne was performed at the Theatre at the Crown Yard, on the High Street, Canterbury on Feb 14 1726.[^ref] Two months later, Mr Keregan's Company of Comedians performed the Restoration tragedy'The Rival Queens or the Death of Alexander the Great' (1677) written by Nathaniel Lee, a contemporary of Behn, who had written a poem 'On the Death of Mrs. Behn' in 1689. 

Pinchbeck's Grand Theatre of the Muses, an automata with scenes and music, plied the streets of Dover, Sandwich and Canterbury in 1729.[^ref]

The Licensing Act of 1737, or ‘Gagging Act’ as it was popularly known, affected theatre in Britain considerably. Production of plays was restricted to two theatres in London – Covent Garden and Drury Lane.  Scripts were censored by the Lord Chamberlain and his examiners, the Master of Revels, until 1843 when it was lifted. To avoid falling foul of this law, rural theatres would intersperse scenes with a variety of melodrama, burlesque, song and dance. On 1 August 1739, the Company of Comedians from the Royal Theatres in London performed 'The Committee: Or, the Faithful Irishman' at the theatre in Canterbury to which was added a new pantomime entertainment in Grotesque characters.[^ref]  On the 17 August 1739, the comedy 'The Tender Husband; Or Accomplished Fools' was performed at The Theatre, Canterbury with entertainments of singing and dancing.[^ref] After the gagging act was lifted, Music Hall became equally, if not more popular than theatre. Starting in the back rooms of pubs, it grew into a ‘working’ peoples entertainment.  

‘Canterbury Smith’ or William Smith, who took over Kentish theatres in 1751 from Perry’s ‘Company of Comedians’ hired Roger Kemble in [what year]. He was the father of Sarah Siddons, a well-known and celebrated actress who often played at the Theatre Royal Margate, John Philip Kemble who was considered ‘England’s finest actor’, and Charles Kemble who often appeared in Canterbury. 

In April 1780, ‘The Oaks or The Beauties of Canterbury’, written by Canterbury pastry cook and mantua maker, [Elizabeth Burgess](/18c/18c-burgess-biography/) was performed at Canterbury’s Theatre, a rickety wooden building over the Buttermarket outside Christchurch Gate. It was printed at her own expense and survives in full. The Prologues were spoken by Mr Miell and the Epilogue by Mrs Dawes. The Buttermarket theatre was also used by [Sarah Baker](/18c/18c-baker-biography/) who opened her own theatre in Canterbury in in 1789. 

Sarah Baker, who built four theatres in Kent, was able to entice new actors from London to join her company, such as Edmund Kean, Thomas Dibdin, Charles Incledon and Joseph Grimaldi, the famous clown. 

Life long members of Sarah Baker’s company were Mr.John Sloman and Mr. Smollett; both wrote and performed songs in between acts. Mrs Baker’s daughter, also Sarah, had married Mr. William Dowton, an actor who’d joined Mrs Baker’s company in 1791. Dowton performed in Canterbury multiple times and ran her theatre empire after her death in 1816. 

On Tuesday, May 6th, 1817, Joseph Grimaldi, whose services had been procured by Mr Dowton, played ‘Bob Acres’ in Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s five part comedy, “The Rivals” at Canterbury Theatre. Grimaldi came from a family of dancers and had performed as a child at Sadler’s Wells, London.  Grimaldi sung one of his best loved songs; ‘Tipitywichet’, before playing ‘Scaramouch’ [sic][^ref1] in “DON JUAN or the Libertine Destroyed”. Scaramouche was a stock character from commedia dell’arte, an unreliable servant.  Joseph Grimaldi is remembered as creator of the modern clown, many of his reminiscences are in his memoir, edited by [Charles Dickens](/dickens/dickens-biography). Thomas Dibdin, also employed in Mrs. Baker’s troupe, recommended Grimaldi for the clown in his successful 1806 pantomime, “Harlequin and Mother Goose”. 

In 1838, the theatre on Orange Street was run by Mr. John Sloman.  The ‘Theatre Royal at Orange Street’ (formerly ‘New Theatre’) was used on occasion before deemed unsafe in 1858.  

In 1860, Thomas Sidney Cooper, painter and local philanthropist, was persuaded by principal members of the Old Stagers, an amateur dramatic group performing in Canterbury since 1842; Mr John Baker and Sir Frederick Ponsoby Fane (later Earl of Bessborough) to build a new theatre.  

One of the first members of the Old Stagers was Alfred Mynn. From a farming family, Mynn was a colossus in stature and cricket; 6ft 1inch tall, weighing between 18 – 19 stone. A _Sporting Life_ correspondent of the time said,  


On playbill no. 218, The Old Stagers performed “J.R.Planche Esq.’s Charles XII” in the “New Temporary Theatre Guildhall Assembly Rooms” (soon to be Theatre Royal) during Canterbury Grand Cricket Week, 1860.  

Sidney Cooper used to paint scenery in the ‘New Theatre’ on Orange Street with Mr Doyle. Back in the 1820s he also painted scenery for the theatre in Hastings, where he met and remained lifelong friends with actor Edmund Kean. 

The Theatre Royal, under the management of W.E. Mills, opened in September 1861. On November 4th, [Charles Dickens](/dickens/dickens-biography) read six chapters of ‘David Copperfield’ at the Theatre Royal. It closed on 30th January, 1926 and was sold to the Lefevre brothers. (Debenhams)  

In 1852, the Victoria Concert Rooms, no.3 Lower Bridge Street were renamed St. George’s Hall. In 1923 it became The Queen’s Concert Hall and Ballroom until 1927, when it was known as The County Hall until 1939. 

Playbill no.246 advertises “St.George’s Hall, 16th June 1898 ‘Sold’ Comedietta in 1 act” with no.245 a letter from the Lord Chamberlain granting a license for the comedietta. 

St.Margaret’s Hall, opened as the ‘New Music Hall’ at no.12, St.Margaret’s Street in 1854. Also known as The Assembly Rooms, it was located behind no.12 and no.13 on St Margaret’s Street and the entrance was a tiny passageway through one of the houses. In 1860, the ‘New’ was dropped from Music Hall and business carried on until 1888 when it was closed and sold. In 1900, it re-opened as St.Margaret’s Hall. 

On May 8th, 1876, a Strange and Wilsons Aetherscope adaptation of a Christmas Carol....Scene II- Cornhill by night – Sir Roger de Coverley...” (a country dance). 

In 1898, the ‘Sarah Thorne Dramatic Company’ presented Dion Boucicault’s ‘The Flying Scud’ at the Theatre Royal, Canterbury. In the play, the hero, Tom Meredith, the villain Grindley Goodge, the comic lead, Nat Gosling and Katey Rideout obsessively follow the fortunes of the eponymous racehorse, and its preparation for the Epsom races. It is from this play where the phrase “I’ve got to see a man about a dog” comes. Sarah Thorne, who was manager of the Theatre Royal in Margate, is best known for opening the first acting school in England which later moved to Chatham. 
                      
In 1909, St Margaret's Hall became the Electric Picture Palace. 

The Electric Theatre, no.49, St.Peter’s Street was opened in 1910 and offered silent films and theatre. By 1940 it was run by Captain Julian Bainbridge, manager of The Canterbury Repertory Theatre and known by that name. 

On 8 June 1911, Mayor Francis Goldney Bennett opened the Electric Theatre on St Peter's Street with its mosaic pavement and glass canopy lit with incandescent lights. As he heralded in a new age of theatre, Goldney praised the exterior which was in keeping with "the old architecture of the city" with its Tudor oak panels but also spoke of the importance of keeping pace with the times, predicting that "picture shows" were here to stay.[^ref2] Thanking the theatre owners, Goldney owned that although he did not wish to be thought as a "kill joy", he was grateful that they had promised the City Council not to put on performances on Sunday, as everyone needed at least one day of rest. In January 1916, under the management of Mr A. Dobson, four reels 'brimful of exciting incidents' were shown over the New Year period, including 'A Society Woman's Ordeal' (an appealing story of a society woman's sacrifice), 'His Lucky Vacation', 'No flirting allowed' and 'Wiffles in Wartime', a story about a hen-pecked husband. W iffles, an endearing buffoon, was the creation of Pathe Freres and seems to have featured in several films, as Canterbury was treated to 'Wiffles in a Musical Vein' just under a week later. This programme was followed later in the month by 'The Exploits of Elaine'(part six), 'The Rounders' featuring Charlie Chaplin, 'The Professional Diner' and 'The Ascent of Mont Blanc'.[^ref3] 

In 1912 it reopened as the Empire Music Hall, then in 1950 it became the first Marlowe Theatre until demolished in 1984 when the second Marlowe Theatre opened at The Friars. This second Marlowe was demolished in 2009 to make way for today’s Marlowe on the same site. 

At 30-31, Northgate, a small theatre was converted from a 17th century house. It has been known as the Canterbury Music Hall, Princess (or just) Alexandra Theatre/ Music Hall, Regency Theatre, The Cannon and Royal George. Rumoured to have closed in 1898, in fact it was used as a variety hall until 1989. When it reopened it was called The Penny Theatre, still functioning today as a pub and theatre and is a Grade II listed building.
