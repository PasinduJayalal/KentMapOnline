Canterbury has a long history of theatrical entertainment. Between AD80 – 90, the Romans built an Amphitheatre in the St. Margaret’s Street area. 
In the 3rd century, a ‘D’ shaped, Flavian style (AD201-300) Amphitheatre was built in the same location.  By Anglo Saxon times, the amphitheatre had decayed. 

St Augustine and Church dramas 

In AD597, Saint Augustine landed in Kent and converted many to Christianity. 

A hundred years later, attitudes had changed towards theatre. Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury banned all wandering players and condemned folk plays. He issued ecclesiastical laws condemning ‘Hoodening’ performances, most popular in East Kent around Christmastime. 

Around AD 1180, Canterbury’s Guild Hall was built on the corner of the High Street and Guildhall Street. Although, mainly used for municipal purposes, it occasionally held musical events. 

By the 15th/16th century, Liturgical dramas were performed all over Britain. 

 ‘Miracle’ plays recounted the lives of saints, while ‘Mystery cycles’ staged stories from the Bible, both performed on wagons.  

Between 1491 – 1520, a church warden from the parish of St Dunstan’s noted; 
<br><br>
“Canterbury has it’s own pageant of St. Thomas, with one hundred billmen and bowmen preceding a pageant wagon. On it, stood the figures of St Thomas, with a mechanical moving head and a hidden bag of blood, four boy knights, with splendidly gilded armour.” 

**Strolling Players**   
Strolling or Wandering Players were the prelude to professional Acting Companies. These players were considered ‘vagabonds’ by law, without patronage from a noblemen or royalty. They toured fairgrounds and race meetings presenting a mixture of acrobatics, drama and songs. Sometimes, these players were paid not to perform, as the Burghmote book in 1595 notes: 
<br><br>
“....there shall not be any playes enterludes tragedies or comedies be played or players suffered to playe within this Cittie on any Sabaothe days nor above twoe dayes together at any tyme.” 

In 1603, The Plague hit London, everything closed. Actors were forced to flee to the provinces; performing in Canterbury, Faversham, Maidstone, Dover, New Romney and Lydd. 

The English Civil War 1642 – 1646 stopped theatre completely. 

After the Civil war ended, The Puritans still suppressed theatre; players were seized and punished; buildings demolished. 
                                           
The Licensing Act of 1737, or ‘Gagging Act’ as it was popularly known, affected theatre in Britain considerably. Production of plays was restricted to two theatres in London – Covent Garden and Drury Lane.  Scripts were censored by the Lord Chamberlain and his examiners, the Master of Revels, until 1843 when it was lifted. To avoid falling foul of this law, especially rural theatres would intersperse scenes with a variety of melodrama, burlesque, song and dance. After the gagging act was lifted, Music Hall became equally, if not more popular than theatre. Starting in the back rooms of pubs, it grew into a ‘working’ peoples entertainment. 
                                                            
**Local Playwrights**    
Christopher (Kit) Marlowe, Tudor spy and playwright, was born in Canterbury in 1564. His most famous plays are : Dr Faustus, Tamberlaine and The Jew Of Malta. In [when] Christopher Marlowe attacked William Corkine with a staff and dagger at the Chequer of Hope.

The Chequer of The Hope was a pilgrim's inn on the west side of Mercery Lane and the High Street. Refurbished in 1392 by the monks of Chillenden Priory for pilgrims visiting Thomas Becket’s shrine, The Hope was extended in 1435 when ‘The Crown Inn’ next door was purchased. The inn served as a theatre venue, with a galleried courtyard, workshops, surrounded by two floors accomodating up to 100 pilgrims. The complex is mentioned in the fifeenth century ‘Tale of Beryn’ and was also known as the ‘Chaucer Inn’. Records of performances and entertainments exist for this venue. Sadly, it was badly burnt in 1865, although some of the facades are still visible on Mercery Lane. 

John ‘Bileous' Bale who was famed for his vitriolic language attacking the Catholic church wrote 'King John'.

[John Lyly](/16c/16c-lyly-biography/) (c.1553-1606), whose father owned the 'Splayed Eagle' near Canterbury Cathedral, may have been born in the city. He went on to run the first theatre in Blackfriars, London and although known for his prose, Lyly pioneered writing specifically for children’s companies. 

Actor and playwright, Stephen Gosson (1554-1624), was christened in St.George’s parish, Canterbury. None of his plays survive. He later became vehemently opposed to the theatre writing ‘The School Of Abuse’ pamphlet, which argued that theatre ‘fostered social evils, such as prostitution’. 


[Aphra Behn](/17c/17c-behn-biography/) (1640?-1689), (or Eaffrey Johnson), playwright and well-known author of Oroonoko, was born in Harbledown. During the 1660’s she wrote ‘The Forc’d Marriage’ for the Duke’s Company under Thomas Betterton, actor and manager. The Duke’s Company was one of two theatre companies (the other, King’s) chartered by Charles I and allowed to perform complete dramas.  Over the years, Behn staged nineteen plays and most likely contributed to more. ‘The Amorous Prince’ was staged in 1671 and ‘The Young King’ in 1679, both tragicomedies of sex and power struggles, where Behn excelled. 

In April 1780, ‘The Oaks or The Beauties of Canterbury’, written by Canterbury pastry cook and mantua maker, [Elizabeth Burgess](/18c/18c-burgess-biography/) was performed at Canterbury’s Theatre, a rickety wooden building over the Buttermarket outside Christchurch Gate. It was printed at her own expense and survives in full. The Prologues were spoken by Mr Miell and the Epilogue by Mrs Dawes. The Buttermarket theatre was also used by [Sarah Baker](/18c/18c-baker-biography/) 

In 1789, [Sarah Baker](/18c/18c-baker-biography/) opened the first theatre in Canterbury. e ‘New Theatre’ on Orange Street was also known as the ‘Prince of Orange Theatre’ and later, Theatre Royal (by 1851).  

Her success as a theatre manager was in part due to her ability to entice new actors from London to join her company in touring Kent. Edmund Kean, Thomas Dibdin, Charles Incledon and Joseph Grimaldi the famous clown, are just a few of the rising stars Sarah Baker gave opportunities to and later, was able to start producing patent plays. 

Life long members of Sarah Baker’s company were Mr.John Sloman and Mr. Smollett; both wrote and performed songs in between acts. Mrs Baker’s daughter, also Sarah, had married Mr. William Dowton, an actor who’d joined Mrs Baker’s company in 1791. Dowton performed in Canterbury multiple times and ran her theatre empire after her death in 1816. 


In 1898, the ‘Sarah Thorne Dramatic Company’ presented Dion Boucicault’s ‘The Flying Scud’ at the Theatre Royal, Canterbury. In the play, the hero, Tom Meredith, the villain Grindley Goodge, the comic lead, Nat Gosling and Katey Rideout obsessively follow the fortunes of the eponymous racehorse, and its preparation for the Epsom races. It is from this play where the phrase “I’ve got to see a man about a dog” comes. Sarah Thorne, who was manager of the Theatre Royal in Margate, is best known for opening the first acting school in England which later moved to Chatham. 


On Tuesday, May 6th, 1817, Joseph Grimaldi, whose services had been procured by Mr Dowton, played ‘Bob Acres’ in Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s five part comedy, “The Rivals” at Canterbury Theatre. Grimaldi came from a family of dancers and had performed as a child at Sadler’s Wells, London.  Grimaldi sung one of his best loved songs; ‘Tipitywichet’, before playing ‘Scaramouch’ [sic][^ref1] in “DON JUAN or the Libertine Destroyed”. Scaramouche was a stock character from commedia dell’arte, an unreliable servant.  

Joseph Grimaldi is remembered as creator of the modern clown, many of his reminiscences are in his memoir, edited by Charles Dickens. Thomas Dibdin, also employed in Mrs. Baker’s troupe, recommended Grimaldi for the clown in his successful 1806 pantomime, “Harlequin and Mother Goose”. 

Playbill no. 56 – “Theatre Canterbury, March 11th, 1823, Mr.(Edmund) Kean, for strictly two nights only” as the Duke of Gloucester in “Richard III”.                         
William Dowton as Old Mirabel and Charles Kemble as Young Mirabel in a scene from the “Inconstant”. (no copyright, USA) 

The Kembles were a large family of actors -  Roger Kemble was hired by ‘Canterbury Smith’ or William Smith, who took over Kentish theatres in 1751 from Perry’s ‘Company of Comedians’. Sarah Siddons, a well-known and celebrated actress who often played at the Theatre Royal Margate, was Roger Kemble’s first-born daughter. Her brother, Charles Kemble often appeared in Canterbury. 

John Philip Kemble was considered ‘England’s finest actor’, a position taken up by Edmund Kean afterwards. Sarah Siddons was John’s sister and was considered the greatest tragedian.  


Theatre Royal  

Mrs Baker’s Kentish theatres passed to her son-in-law, William Dowton. Later, in 1838, the theatre on Orange Street was run by Mr. John Sloman, a frequent member of Canterbury productions.  The ‘Theatre Royal at Orange Street’ (formerly ‘New Theatre’) was used on occasion before deemed unsafe in 1858.  

In 1860, Thomas Sidney Cooper, painter and local philanthropist, was persuaded by Canterbury cricketers; Mr John Baker and Sir Frederick Ponsoby Fane (later Earl of Bessborough) to build a new theatre. Fane and Baker were also principal members of the Old Stagers, an amateur dramatic group performing in Canterbury since 1842.  

One of the first members of the Old Stagers was Alfred Mynn. From a farming family, Mynn was a colossus in stature and cricket; 6ft 1inch tall, weighing between 18 – 19 stone. A _Sporting Life_ correspondent of the time said,  

“Not only [was he] one of the best cricketers that ever played for Kent but one of the most kindly-disposed, generous, large-hearted, noblest-formed men that ever trod the green turf so dear to cricketers”  

 In 1845, Mynn had mysteriously missed several matches of the season, but was in Bath in August, when four bailiffs with a warrant appeared for him, mid game. Mynn and his friends persuaded them to wait until the close of play, and as if from a scene in Mynn’s stage life ensued. Mynn had shut himself in his dressing room while his friends, Robert Fookes, a brewer and Robert Kynesman Mapletoft Brookes, a landowner, started a hoo-hah outside. Brookes shouted “Damn your eyes, you shan’t have him” as they fell on the bailiffs, beating them up. Unfortunately, several days later, Mynn, Fookes and Brookes were all arrested.  

(from Simon Burnton’s The Spin in The Guardian, 26th November, 2019) 

On playbill no. 218, The Old Stagers performed “J.R.Planche Esq.’s Charles XII” in the “New Temporary Theatre Guildhall Assembly Rooms” (soon to be Theatre Royal) during Canterbury Grand Cricket Week, 1860.  

Sidney Cooper used to paint scenery in the ‘New Theatre’ on Orange Street with Mr Doyle. Back in the 1820’s he also painted scenery for the theatre in Hastings, where he met and remained lifelong friends with actor Edmund Kean. 

The Theatre Royal, under the management of W.E. Mills, opened in September 1861. On November 4th, 1861 [Charles Dickens](/dickens/dickens-biography) read six chapters of ‘David Copperfield’ at the Theatre Royal. It closed on 30th January, 1926 and was sold to the Lefevre brothers. (Debenhams)  

In 1852, the Victoria Concert Rooms, no.3 Lower Bridge Street were renamed St. George’s Hall. In 1923 it became The Queen’s Concert Hall and Ballroom until 1927, when it was known as The County Hall until 1939. 

Playbill no.246 advertises “St.George’s Hall, 16th June 1898 ‘Sold’ Comedietta in 1 act” with no.245 a letter from the Lord Chamberlain granting a license for the comedietta. 

St.Margaret’s Hall, opened as the ‘New Music Hall’ at no.12, St.Margaret’s Street in 1854 and was approved by city council. Also known as The Assembly Rooms, it was located behind no.12 and no.13 on St Margaret’s Street and the entrance was a tiny passageway through one of the houses. In 1860, the ‘New’ was dropped from Music Hall and business carried on until 1888 when it was closed and sold. In 1900, it re-opened as St.Margaret’s Hall. Apparently, many advertisements exist for a variety of events held at this hall throughout its existence, but not much detail of its interior. 

One such event is listed for May 8th, 1876, on playbill no.223 - “Music Hall, Canterbury.......Strange and Wilsons Aetherscope adaptation of a Christmas Carol....Scene II- Cornhill by night – Sir Roger de Coverley...” (a country dance). 

In 1909, St Margaret's Hall became the Electric Picture Palace. 

The Electric Theatre, no.49, St.Peter’s Street was opened in 1910 and offered silent films and theatre. By 1940 it was run by Captain Julian Bainbridge, manager of The Canterbury Repertory Theatre and known by that name. 

On 8 June 1911, Mayor Francis Goldney Bennett opened the Electric Theatre on St Peter's Street with its mosaic pavement and glass canopy lit with incandescent lights. As he heralded in a new age of theatre, Goldney praised the exterior which was in keeping with "the old architecture of the city" with its Tudor oak panels but also spoke of the importance of keeping pace with the times, predicting that "picture shows" were here to stay.[^ref2] Thanking the theatre owners, Goldney owned that although he did not wish to be thought as a "kill joy", he was grateful that they had promised the City Council not to put on performances on Sunday, as everyone needed at least one day of rest. In January 1916, 'three reels, brimful of exciting incidents' was shown over the New Year period, including 'A Society Woman's Ordeal', 'His Lucky Vacation' and 'Wiffles in Wartime', a story about a hen-pecked husband. This was followed later in the month by 'The Exploits of Elaine', 'The Rounders' featuring Charlie Chaplin, 'The Professional Diner' and 'The Ascent of Mont Blanc'.

In 1912 it reopened as the Empire Music Hall, then in 1950 it became the first Marlowe Theatre until demolished in 1984 when the second Marlowe Theatre opened at The Friars. This second Marlowe was demolished in 2009 to make way for today’s Marlowe on the same site. 

The Forester’s Hall, no.47, High Street on the south side, opened in 1860 and was created by the Ancient Order of Foresters. (later Nason’s.) 



At 30-31, Northgate, a small theatre was converted from a 17th century house. It has been known as the Canterbury Music Hall, Princess (or just) Alexandra Theatre/ Music Hall, Regency Theatre, The Cannon and Royal George. Rumoured to have closed in 1898, in fact it was used as a variety hall until 1989. When it reopened it was called The Penny Theatre, still functioning today as a pub and theatre and is a Grade II listed building.
