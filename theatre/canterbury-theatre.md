A Brief timeline of Performances in Canterbury 

 

The Romans 

Between AD80 – 90, the Romans built an Amphitheatre in the St. Margaret’s Street area. 

 

Later, Ceasar comments; 

“....by far the most civilized of the Britons, are those who live in Kent.” 

 

In the 3rd century, most of Canterbury’s buildings were upgraded, and a ‘D’ shaped, Flavian style (AD201-300) Amphitheatre was built in the same location.  

Under The Anglo Saxons, the theatre was left to decay – The Normans used some of its masonry for their buildings. 

 

St Augustine and Church dramas 

 

In AD597, Saint Augustine landed in Kent and converted many to Christianity. 

A hundred years later, attitudes had changed towards theatre. Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury banned all wandering players and condemned folk plays. He issued ecclesiastical laws condemning ‘Hoodening’ performances, most popular in East Kent around Christmastime. 

By the 15th/16th century, Liturgical dramas were performed all over Britain. 

 ‘Miracle’ plays recounted the lives of saints, while ‘Mystery cycles’ staged stories from the Bible, both performed on wagons.  

Between 1491 – 1520, a church warden from the parish of St Dunstan’s noted; 

“Canterbury has it’s own pageant of St. Thomas, with one hundred billmen and bowmen preceding a pageant wagon. On it, stood the figures of St Thomas, with a mechanical moving head and a hidden bag of blood, four boy knights, with splendidly gilded armour.” 

 

Strolling Players 

 Strolling or Wandering Players were the prelude to professional Acting Companies. These players were considered ‘vagabonds’ by law, without patronage from a noblemen or royalty. They toured fairgrounds and race meetings presenting a mixture of acrobatics, drama and songs. 

Sometimes, these players were paid not to perform, as the Burghmote book in 1595 notes: 

“....there shall not be any playes enterludes tragedies or comedies be played or players suffered to playe within this Cittie on any Sabaothe days nor above twoe dayes together at any tyme.” 

 

In 1603, The Plague hit London, everything closed. Actors were forced to flee to the provinces; performing in Canterbury, Faversham, Maidstone, Dover, New Romney and Lydd. 

 

The English Civil War 1642 – 1646 stopped theatre completely. 

 After the Civil war ended, The Puritans still suppressed theatre; players were seized and punished; buildings demolished.

The Licensing Act of 1737, or ‘Gagging Act’ as it was popularly known, affected theatre in Britain considerably. Production of plays was restricted to two theatres in London – Covent Garden and Drury Lane. 

Scripts were censored by the Lord Chamberlain and his examiners, the Master of Revels, until 1843 when it was lifted. To avoid falling foul of this law, especially rural theatres would intersperse scenes with a variety of melodrama, burlesque, song and dance. 

Melodrama – borrowed from Italian, meaning opera, it has become a theatrical term for a drama where the words are spoken to music; with stock characters exaggerated. 

Burlesque – also from Italian: burla – to mock or ridicule an existing figure.  

                                                             

Local Playwrights 

 

In 1564, Christopher (Kit)Marlowe was born. His most famous plays are : Dr Faustus, Tamberlaine and The Jew Of Malta.

Also from this era, three dramatists with connections to Canterbury were: 

John Bale - dubbed ‘Bileous Bale’ for his vitriolic language attacking the Catholic church. His most famous play is ‘King John’. 

John Lyly, went to the King’s School, Canterbury before Oxford University. He went on to run the first theatre in Blackfriars, London and although known for his prose, Lyly pioneered writing specifically for children’s companies. 

Stephen Gosson, was christened in St.George’s parish, Canterbury. He became an actor and playwright best known for his ‘The School Of Abuse’ pamphlet; criticizing theatre and art alike, claiming they ‘fostered social evils, such as prostitution’. 

 

 Leading Women 

Aphra Behn 1640?-1689 

Aphra Behn, (or Eaffrey Johnson) was born in Bishopsbourne, Sturry, Canterbury, Wye or Harbledown. The well-known author of Oroonoko, she was also a phenomenal playwright. During the 1660’s she wrote ‘The Forc’d Marriage’ for the Duke’s Company under Thomas Betterton, actor and manager. 

 The Duke’s Company was one of two theatre companies (the other, King’s) chartered by Charles I and allowed to perform complete dramas. 

According to some, Aphra Behn was involved in espionage for King Charles II, trusted with an important mission by courtier Thomas Killigrew. 

Over the years, Behn staged nineteen plays and most likely contributed to more. ‘The Amorous Prince’ was staged in 1671 and ‘The Young King’ in 1679, both tragicomedies of sex and power struggles, where Behn excelled. 

 

 

Sarah Baker (nee Wakelin)1736/7-1816 

Sarah Baker was born in Milton, near Sittingbourne. She started out as a tumbler and puppeteer in her mother, Ann Wakelin’s ‘Sadler’s Wells’ troupe of wandering performers. Sarah became manager of the troupe when her mother retired; touring Southeast England, race meetings and fairgrounds.  

She married a performer from the troupe, Mr. Baker, who sadly died soon after, leaving Sarah with three children to feed. Her son, Henry Baker became a successful actor, as her daughter, also Sarah, did. 

Sarah Baker was Kent’s first successful businesswomen. When she opened the first theatre in Canterbury since Roman times, she was already in her 50’s. The ‘New Theatre’ on Orange Street was also known as the ‘Prince of Orange Theatre’ and later, Theatre Royal (by 1851). 

Sarah went on to build theatres in Rochester 1791, Maidstone 1798 and Tunbridge Wells 1802. 

Her success as a theatre manager was in part due to her ability to entice new actors from London to join her company in touring Kent. Edmund Kean, Thomas Dibdin, Charles Incledon and Joseph Grimaldi the famous clown, are just a few of the rising stars Sarah Baker gave opportunities to and later, was able to start producing patent plays.

Life long members of Sarah Baker’s company were Mr.John Sloman and Mr. Smollett; both wrote and performed songs in between acts.

When Sarah Baker died in Rochester, just shy of 80 years old, her grandson estimated her estate to be worth over £20,000 in today’s money; a figure most women could only dream of. 

Mrs Baker’s daughter, also Sarah, had married Mr. William Dowton, an actor who’d joined Mrs Baker’s company in 1791. Dowton performed in Canterbury multiple times and ran her theatre empire after her death in 1816. 

Dover and Margate were the only towns Mrs Baker could not monopolize. This was due to a retired sea captain, Charles Mate, getting there first, and influencing those who mattered.

Sarah Thorne 

From a large theatre family, Sarah Thorne is best known for opening the first acting school in England. She was manager of the Theatre Royal in Margate, where she opened her school, which later moved to Chatham. 

In 1898, the ‘Sarah Thorne Dramatic Company’ presented: Dion Boucicault’s ‘The Flying Scud’ at the Theatre Royal, Canterbury; and is where the phrase “I’ve got to see a man about a dog” comes from. 

Dion Boucicault or Dionysis Lardner Boursiquot (from a Huguenot family), was an actor and Irish playwright; the first to portray sporting heroes in the spectacular melodrama genre. In the Flying Scud, the plot follows a group of people obsessed with the racehorse, its preparation and the Epsom races. The hero is Tom Meredith, the villain Grindley Goodge, the comic lead is Nat Gosling and the female lead, Katey Rideout.  

The Coleen Bawn was another popular melodrama written by Boucicault. In America at the time, Boucicault based his play on an 1829 Gerald Griffin murder novel, ‘The Collegians’, with Boucicault substituting a happy ending, it opened at Laura Keene’s theatre, N.Y. in 1860, later transferring to London and provincial theatres.

Jean Napier Baker (no relation to Sarah Baker) emphasizes in her dissertation, how few records exist for the eighteenth century in provincial theatres. Her thesis, written over twenty years ago, is still the only detail available for this era in Kent. Although the University of Kent houses several theatre collections, as with other establishments, the information is unavailable online. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At The Beaney... 

The Canterbury museum has many playbills for performances on stages in the city. 

Playbill no.15 - Joseph Grimaldi plays ‘Bob Acres’ in Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s five part comedy, “The Rivals”. Grimaldi came from a family of dancers and had performed as a child at Sadler’s Wells, London. Underneath “Canterbury Theatre, Tuesday, May 6th, 1817”, reads: 

“Having received information that his services are not required at The Theatre Royal, Covent Garden this eve, Mr.Dowton has availed himself of the opportunity and begs leave to announce that he will appear for one night more....” 

Grimaldi sings one of his best loved songs; ‘Tipitywichet’, before playing ‘Scaramouch’(spelt without the ‘e’ on playbill) in “DON JUAN or the Libertine Destroyed”. Scaramouche was a stock character from commedia dell’arte, an unreliable servant.  

Joseph Grimaldi is remembered as creator of the modern clown, many of his reminiscences are in his memoir, edited by Charles Dickens. Thomas Dibdin, also employed in Mrs. Baker’s troupe, recommended Grimaldi for the clown in his successful 1806 pantomime, “Harlequin and Mother Goose”. 

Playbill no. 56 – “Theatre Canterbury, March 11th, 1823, Mr.(Edmund) Kean, for strictly two nights only” as the Duke of Gloucester in “Richard III”.

The Kembles were a large family of actors -  Roger Kemble was hired by ‘Canterbury Smith’ or William Smith, who took over Kentish theatres in 1751 from Perry’s ‘Company of Comedians’. Sarah Siddons, a well-known and celebrated actress who often played at the Theatre Royal Margate, was Roger Kemble’s first-born daughter. Her brother, Charles Kemble (11th born) often appeared in Canterbury. 

John Philip Kemble was considered ‘England’s finest actor’, a position taken up by Edmund Kean afterwards. Sarah Siddons was John’s sister and was considered the greatest tragedian.  

 

                                         

 

 

 

 

The Chequer Of The Hope 

The Chequer of The Hope was a group of buildings on the west side of Mercery Lane and the High Street. Refurbished in 1392 by the monks of Chillenden Priory for pilgrims visiting Thomas Becket’s shrine, The Hope was extended in 1435 when ‘The Crown Inn’ next door was purchased. 

The inn served as a theatre venue, with a galleried courtyard, workshops, surrounded by two floors accomodating up to 100 pilgrims. The complex is mentioned in Chaucer’s ‘Tale of Beryn’ from the ‘Canterbury Tales’ and was also known as the ‘Chaucer Inn’. Records of performances and entertainments exist for this venue. Sadly, it was badly burnt in 1865, although some of the facades are still visible on Mercery Lane.  

The Buttermarket 

The Buttermarket was also known as the market-cross or bull-stake and was used as a theatre venue by Mrs Baker among others, offering shelter from the elements. 

The Guildhall 

Around AD1180, Canterbury’s Guild Hall was built on the corner of the High Street and Guildhall Street. Mainly used for municipal purposes, occasionally it held musical events. 

 

 

Theatre Royal  

 Mrs Baker’s Kentish theatres passed to her son-in-law, William Dowton. Later, in 1838, the theatre on Orange Street was run by Mr. John Sloman, a frequent member of Canterbury productions.  The ‘Theatre Royal at Orange Street’ (formerly ‘New Theatre’) was used on occasion before deemed unsafe in 1858.  

In 1860, Thomas Sidney Cooper, painter and local philanthropist, was persuaded by Canterbury cricketers; Mr John Baker (no relation to Mrs Sarah Baker) and Sir Frederick Ponsoby Fane (later Earl of Bessborough) to build a new theatre. Fane and Baker were also principal members of the Old Stagers, an amateur dramatic group performing in Canterbury since 1842.  

One of the first members of the Old Stagers was Alfred Mynn. From a farming family, Mynn was a colossus in stature and cricket; 6ft 1inch tall, weighing between 18 – 19 stone. A Sporting Life correspondent of the time said,  

“Not only [was he] one of the best cricketers that ever played for Kent but one of the most kindly-disposed, generous, large-hearted, noblest-formed men that ever trod the green turf so dear to cricketers”  

 In 1845, Mynn had mysteriously missed several matches of the season, but was in Bath in August, when four bailiffs with a warrant appeared for him, mid game. Mynn and his friends persuaded them to wait until the close of play, and as if from a scene in Mynn’s stage life ensued. Mynn had shut himself in his dressing room while his friends, Robert Fookes, a brewer and Robert Kynesman Mapletoft Brookes, a landowner, started a hoo-hah outside. Brookes shouted “Damn your eyes, you shan’t have him” as they fell on the bailiffs, beating them up. Unfortunately, several days later, Mynn, Fookes and Brookes were all arrested.  

(from Simon Burnton’s The Spin in The Guardian, 26th November, 2019) 

On playbill no. 218, The Old Stagers performed “J.R.Planche Esq.’s Charles XII” in the “New Temporary Theatre Guildhall Assembly Rooms” (soon to be Theatre Royal) during Canterbury Grand Cricket Week, 1860.  

Sidney Cooper used to paint scenery in the ‘New Theatre’ on Orange Street with Mr Doyle. Back in the 1820’s he also painted scenery for the theatre in Hastings, where he met and remained lifelong friends with actor Edmund Kean. 

The Theatre Royal, under the management of W.E.Mills, finally opened in September 1861. 

On November 4th, 1861 Charles Dickens read six chapters of ‘David Copperfield’ at the Theatre Royal. 

It closed on 30th January, 1926 and sold to the Lefevre brothers. (Debenhams)  

In 1852, the Victoria Concert Rooms, no.3 Lower Bridge Street were renamed St. George’s Hall. In 1923 it became The Queen’s Concert Hall and Ballroom until 1927, when it was known as The County Hall until 1939. 

Playbill no.246 advertises “St.George’s Hall, 16th June 1898 ‘Sold’ Comedietta in 1 act” with no.245 a letter from the Lord Chamberlain granting a license for the comedietta. 

St.Margaret’s Hall, opened as the ‘New Music Hall’ at no.12, St.Margaret’s Street in 1854 and was approved by city council. Also known as The Assembly Rooms, it was located behind no.12 and no.13 on St Margaret’s Street and the entrance was a tiny passageway through one of the houses. In 1860, the ‘New’ was dropped from Music Hall and business carried on until 1888 when it was closed and sold. In 1900, it re-opened as St.Margaret’s Hall. Apparently, many advertisements exist for a variety of events held at this hall throughout its existence, but not much detail of its interior. 

One such event is listed for May 8th, 1876, on playbill no.223 - “Music Hall, Canterbury.......Strange and Wilsons Aetherscope adaptation of a Christmas Carol....Scene II- Cornhill by night – Sir Roger de Coverley...” (a country dance). 

 

At the same location, in 1909 just before the First World War, the Electric Picture Palace opened. In 1912 it reopened as the Empire Music Hall, then in 1950 it became the first Marlowe Theatre until demolished in 1984 when the second Marlowe Theatre opened at The Friars. This second Marlowe was demolished in 2009 to make way for today’s Marlowe on the same site. 

The Forester’s Hall, no.47, High Street on the south side, opened in 1860 and was created by the Ancient Order of Foresters. (later Nason’s.) 

The Electric Theatre, no.49, St.Peter’s Street was built in 1910 and offered silent films and theatre. By 1940 it was run by Captain Julian Bainbridge, manager of The Canterbury Repertory Theatre and known by that name. 

 

At 30-31, Northgate, a small theatre was converted from a 17th century house. It has been known as the Canterbury Music Hall, Princess (or just) Alexandra Theatre/ Music Hall, Regency Theatre, The Cannon and Royal George. Rumoured to have closed in 1898, in fact it was used as a variety hall until 1989. When it reopened it was called The Penny Theatre, still functioning today as a pub and theatre and is a Grade II listed building. 

 

 

 

 

 

After the gagging act was lifted in 1843, Music Hall became equally, if not more popular than theatre. Starting in the back rooms of pubs, it grew into a ‘working’ peoples entertainment.
