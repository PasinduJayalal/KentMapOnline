John Wallis (1616-1703)

The mathematician, John Wallis, was born in Ashford on the 23rd of November 1616. His father, Reverend John Wallis (1567-1622), who was the vicar of St Mary’s died a week after John’s sixth birthday. His mother, Joanna Chapman, was from Godmersham, six miles north-east of Ashford.

John began his education in Ashford, but after an outbreak of plague in 1625, was moved by his mother to James Mouat’s private school at Ley (Leigh) Green, near Tenterden.  He continued at Mouat’s school until 1630, when he was enrolled at a school in Felsted. Essex. During the Christmas holidays of 1631 his brother Henry taught him arithmetic which according to Wallis: “suited my humour so well that I did henceforth prosecute it, not as a formal study, but as a pleasing diversion at spare hours.” In 1632 he went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge on a scholarship where he studied ethics, physics, metaphysics, medicine and anatomy.

On attaining his M.A in 1640, Wallis became a private chaplain, but it was his talent for deciphering the intercepted letters and papers of the Royalists for the parliamentarian cause during the English civil war that got him noticed. He was rewarded with the living of St Gabriel, Fenchurch Street in 1643, the same year that his mother died leaving him a substantial estate in Kent. Now a wealthy man, Wallis was free to pursue his intellectual interests, attending meetings in London and Oxford.

Continuing to help the parliamentarians, Wallis was held in high regard by Oliver Cromwell who awarded him with the Savilian Chair of geometry at Oxford in 1649.  In 1655 he published _Arithmetica Infinitorum_, which became a seminal mathematical work. As an undergraduate, Isaac Newton, developed his binomial theorem after reading it. Wallis contributed to the study of trigonometry, calculus, geometry and infinity and corresponded with Fermat and Pascal.

At the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Wallis was keen to refute any claims that he had deciphered Charles I’s correspondence in such a way that might have harmed the king and in fact implied that he “could have discovered a great deal”. In recognition that he had signed the remonstrance against the king’s execution in 1648, he was allowed to keep his posts and was also nominated a royal chaplain.

In 1667 Wallis wrote a letter “concerning the variety of the high-tydes as to several places; with respect to his own hypothesis”. In it he said that further to his assertion that the annual high tides were not on the two equinoxes of 11 March and September, nor on the winter and summer solstices but at a middle time: “and particularly for the Coast of Kent (and consequently the Rivers of Thames and Medway) about the beginning of November and February”, sea currents were north-easterly and this contributed to the regional variations in high tides observed by others. It was written from Oxford, and it is unlikely that he visited Kent at this time.

After the revolution, Wallis worked for William III, deciphering correspondence which was thought to shed light on the birth of the Prince of Wales.

He died at Oxford in 1703. Today, the John Wallis Academy, a primary school and a pub in Ashford are named after him.

Wallis is not the only mathematician associated with Kent. John Edensor Littlewood, who researched Diophantine analysis and the Riemann zeta function was born in Rochester and Ada Lovelace lived in xxx
