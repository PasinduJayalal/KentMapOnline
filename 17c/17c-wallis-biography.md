The mathematician, John Wallis, was born in Ashford on the 23rd of November 1616. His father, Reverend John Wallis (1567-1622), who was the vicar of St Mary’s died a week after John’s sixth birthday. His mother, Joanna Chapman, was from Godmersham, six miles north-east of Ashford.

John began his education in Ashford, but after an outbreak of plague in 1625, was moved by his mother to James Mouat’s private school at Ley (Leigh) Green, near Tenterden.  He continued at Mouat’s school until 1630, then in 1631 he was enrolled at the school of Martin Holbeach in Felsted, Essex. During the Christmas holidays of 1631 his brother Henry taught him arithmetic which according to Wallis: “suited my humour so well that I did henceforth prosecute it, not as a formal study, but as a pleasing diversion at spare hours.” In 1632 he went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge on a scholarship where he studied ethics, physics, metaphysics, medicine and anatomy.

On attaining his M.A in 1640, Wallis became a private chaplain, but it was his talent for deciphering the intercepted letters and papers of the Royalists for the parliamentarian cause during the English civil war that got him noticed. He was rewarded with the living of St Gabriel, Fenchurch Street in 1643, the same year that his mother died leaving him a substantial estate in Kent. His mother had bought "A messuage, barn, and various buildings, closes, gardens and orchards, and 6 parcels of arrable, meadow and pasture land called Vaggestowne, the Littlecroft next the lane, Great Culverlese, Little Culverlese and Perycroft, in Egerton" from John Deedes in 1633 however there had been a quitclaim four years later. Nevertheless this gives some clues as to the area of Kent where his property may have been.[^ref1] Now a wealthy man, Wallis was free to pursue his intellectual interests, attending meetings in London and Oxford. 

Continuing to help the parliamentarians, Wallis was held in high regard by Oliver Cromwell who awarded him with the Savilian Chair of geometry at Oxford in 1649.  In 1655 he published _Arithmetica Infinitorum_, which became a seminal mathematical work. As an undergraduate, Isaac Newton, developed his binomial theorem after reading it. Wallis contributed to the study of trigonometry, calculus, geometry and infinity and corresponded with Fermat and Pascal. It is unlikely that Wallis spent much time in Kent at this period, although he still had associations with the county.  His brother Henry wrote to him from Lydd in 1651; Samuel Shorte wrote to "his much respected friend" from Tenterden in 1653; and John Finch wrote to him from Rolvenden in 1653.  In a letter from his brother Henry dated 6th March 1654 and sent from Ashford, John Wallis has written on the back: "`Reasons why the limits of the Commission should not bee bounded as is desired by Sir Cheyny Culpeper, to Oxny Ferry" revealing that he still has some interests in the area.[^ref2] Indeed according to Wallis during the period 1859/1860: "I was my self very little at Oxford all that time, (and, much of it, my Family was also absent, in London, Kent, Essex, and Cambridge)" revealing his continued connection with the county.

At the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Wallis was keen to refute any clams that he had deciphered Charles I’s correspondence in such a way that might have harmed the king and in fact implied that he “could have discovered a great deal”. In recognition that he had signed the remonstrance against the king’s execution in 1648, he was allowed to keep his posts and was also nominated a royal chaplain.

In 1667, whilst investigating high tides, Wallis argued that annual high tides were not on the two equinoxes, nor on the winter and summer solstices but at a middle time: “and particularly for the Coast of Kent (and consequently the Rivers of Thames and Medway) about the beginning of November and February”. Two years later in 1669/70 he received letters from Hythe recording one of the highest tides they had had in a while. We do not know who these were from but we do know that Wallis had relatives in Hythe (his niece Anne was married to Julius Deedes, the captain of the Hythe militia).[^ref3] It is at this period Wallis is known to have visited Kent during the months of April and May 1670 with his son John who fell ill of "a very desperate malignant fever ... which after did degenerate into a Chronick desease (of which part was a Kentish ague)". Wallis records: "After a considerable stay where I was; til I saw him begin (as wee hoped) to amend; I was fain (being called home) to leave him there behind mee." It is clear that Wallis considered Oxford not Kent as his home.[^ref4]

After the Glorious revolution of 1688, Wallis worked for William III, deciphering correspondence which was thought to shed light on the birth of the Prince of Wales (James Francis Edward Stuart). Later, his grandson William Blencoe, whom he had taught, became a government cryptographer.

John Wallis died at Oxford in 1703. An autobiographical account of his life is held at the Kent Archives. Today, the John Wallis Academy in Ashford is named after him.

He is not the only mathematician associated with Kent. John Edensor Littlewood, who researched Diophantine analysis and the Riemann zeta function was born in Rochester and Ada Lovelace spent her summers in Kent.
